    ""Reasoning"": ""Ethanol production, primarily from corn or sugarcane, involves energy inputs for farming, processing, transportation, and distillation. Historically, studies debated whether ethanol had a negative energy balance (more energy input than output). However, modern analyses (e.g., USDA, Argonne National Lab) show improvements due to efficient farming, co-product utilization (e.g., animal feed), and advanced processing. Current consensus indicates corn ethanol yields a net positive energy balance of 1.5–2.5 units per unit input. Sugarcane ethanol is even more efficient. Thus, ethanol generally produces more energy than required to make it, though regional variations exist. Confidence is high but not absolute due to dependencies on feedstock, technology, and methodology."",

For most common media, like air or water, sound is non-dispersive, meaning the speed is constant regardless of frequency when temperature is held constant. This is because the wave equation \( v = f \lambda \) implies that speed (\( v \)) is independent of frequency (\( f \)) in such cases; only wavelength (\( \lambda \)) changes with frequency. While dispersion can occur in some solids or under specific conditions (e.g., very high frequencies), for typical scenarios like sound in air at audible frequencies, speed does not vary with frequency.
