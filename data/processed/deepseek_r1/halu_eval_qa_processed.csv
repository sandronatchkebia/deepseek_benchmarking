**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states ""He was also a United States Navy combat veteran of World War II"" immediately following the list of actors. Jason Robards (1922–2000) is historically documented as a decorated WWII Navy veteran who served in the Pacific Theater, aligning with the context. Other actors (e.g., Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman) were born post-WWII or lack military records matching this service.

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states:  
1. Bayern signed Dante among others  
2. Dante's birthdate is ""18 October 1983""  
No other signed players have their birthdates mentioned in the context.

Explanation:  
The context explicitly states: ""It [Bengali] is the national and official language of the People's Republic of Bangladesh."" This is a direct, unambiguous statement requiring no interpretation. The mention of Indian states where Bengali is official does not contradict Bangladesh's status as the nation where Bengali holds both national and official designation.

- No other signed players have birthdates mentioned, eliminating ambiguity.  
- Confidence is 0.99 (near-certain) since the answer is directly supported by the text.

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states Alexander Thynn (author of ""The Carry-Cot,"" which inspired the film *Blue Blood*) had an estimated wealth of **£157 million** in the 2009 Sunday Times Rich List. The term ""wealth intensifying"" appears to be a misinterpretation or typo; the context only provides the author's wealth, not the novel's financial impact.

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states that ""Stomp the Yard"" (the 2007 film using ""Let's Go"") was released on **January 12, 2007**. The confidence is 0.95 (95%) because:  
1. The context directly provides the release date.

However, the context does not specify the album's name or mention a *specific song* about her, only the album's overarching tribute.

2. Yo Gotti (Mario Mims) debuted in 1996 as ""Lil Yo"" with the album *Youngsta's On a Come Up*.  
No other artists in the context are linked to a 1996 debut.

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states SL Green Realty operates only in New York City, while General Motors operates in 35 countries.  
- GM's multinational presence (manufacturing, distribution, and financial services across 35 nations) is fundamentally broader than SL Green's single-city focus.

- **General Motors** operates in 35 countries with diversified activities (manufacturing, distribution, financial services), indicating significantly broader geographic and operational scope.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) because the context explicitly states GM's multinational presence versus SL Green's localized focus.

However, external knowledge verifies he was FIU's head coach from 2007–2012.

**Explanation:**  
The context explains that Corbin's urbanized area extends beyond its city limits due to Kentucky's law prohibiting cities from spanning more than two counties. This means Corbin's *incorporated* area (official city size) is artificially limited, while Gray (mentioned in the question as a distinct community 4.9 miles west) likely has a larger incorporated territory by comparison.

**Confidence Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states Jem Finer is the creator of Longplayer and confirms his full name (Jeremy Max Finer) and exact birthdate (25 July 1955).  
- Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) because while the context is unambiguous, there's a minimal chance of transcription errors in the provided text.

**Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states: *""She was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in 'Picket Fences'""*.  
- ""Picket Fences"" is a television series (1992–1996), not a movie, which directly addresses the query about her nomination.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) because the context is unambiguous, though deducted 0.05 due to the question's incorrect assumption of a ""movie"" nomination.","The actress Amy Aquino, who played Donna in ""Being Human"", was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in the TV series ""Picket Fences"" (not a movie).

- Reiterates ""it is the **largest mall in Wisconsin**""  

This confirms Southridge Mall is tied for **largest**, not second largest. Confidence is 0.95 (high) because:  
1. The phrasing ""tied with... largest mall"" is unambiguous.  
2. The conflicting size metric (1.21M vs. 1.26M sq ft) is likely a contextual error but doesn’t negate the explicit tie for largest status.

**Reasoning:**  
- The context states Pietro Ferrero (d. 1949) laid the groundwork for Nutella by adding hazelnut to chocolate in the 1940s.  
- However, Nutella was **first introduced in 1965** by Ferrero SpA, the company he founded.  
- Since Pietro died 16 years before Nutella's launch, he did not introduce the final product.  
- Confidence is 1.0 because the timeline is unambiguous: Pietro’s groundwork (1940s) ≠ product launch (1965).",Pietro Ferrero never introduced the product.,False,True,,Pietro Ferrero never introduced the product.,1.0,1965,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states that **Darbari Kanada** was brought into North Indian music by Miyan Tansen. The question asks about the raga sung/played in *drut laya* **before** a *vilambit* composition in raga Adana. According to the context, Adana is performed in *drut laya* **after** a *vilambit* in Darbari Kanada. Thus, the raga preceding Adana is Darbari Kanada, which Miyan Tansen introduced.  

Confidence is 0.95 (very high) because:  
1. The context directly attributes Darbari Kanada's introduction to Miyan Tansen.  
2. The temporal relationship between Darbari Kanada (slow *vilambit*) and Adana (fast *drut*) is clearly stated.  
Minor uncertainty (0.05) arises from the question phrasing ""before a vilambit composition in raga Adana,"" which slightly inverts the sequence, but the logical flow remains consistent with the context.",Miyan Tansen,False,True,,Miyan Tansen,0.95,Miyan Tansen,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

This perfectly matches the description in the question. While Hungry Howie's offers chicken wings, the cuisine term itself is ""Buffalo wings"" as defined in the context.

- Confidence is 0.95 (high) because the context directly links the fillér to the korona, though minor ambiguity exists from the mention of multiple currencies (korona/pengő/forint).

**Confidence Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states that the district is part of the National Bison Range Complex, which focuses on wildlife conservation (specifically mentioning the American bison sanctuary). While it doesn't list other species, the direct association with the complex implies that wildlife, particularly bison, can be found there. Confidence is 0.85 because:  
- The context directly links the district to the bison-focused complex (strong evidence).  
- No contradictory information exists.

**Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states that *Steal This Album!* (which includes ""Innervision"") was released on **November 26, 2002**.

  1. The context directly provides the date.  
  2. ""Innervision"" is confirmed to be on this album (common knowledge, though not explicitly listed in the context).

**Confidence Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly identifies Howard Hawks as a ""screenwriter,"" while Arthur Berthelet is solely described as a ""director"" with no mention of screenwriting.  
- This strongly suggests Hawks had screenwriting credits that Berthelet did not. However, without explicit production counts, there's a 15% chance Berthelet had unmentioned screenwriting work.  
- Confidence is high (0.85) because the context deliberately attributes screenwriting only to Hawks.","Yes, based on the context, Howard Hawks was a screenwriter while Arthur Berthelet is only described as a director, implying Hawks contributed to more productions as a screenwriter.",False,True,,"Yes, based on the context, Howard Hawks was a screenwriter while Arthur Berthelet is only described as a director, implying Hawks contributed to more productions as a screenwriter.",0.85,yes,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

- For Medina, the context specifies ""three or four players"" but adds that variations allow ""2 or 5 players"", confirming it supports ≥2 players.

- The only overlapping role explicitly mentioned for both is **film director**.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) because the context provides direct evidence of this shared profession, though minor uncertainty exists due to their additional distinct roles (writer/producer).

1. The birthdate is directly linked to Mike Reid in the context.

    ""Answer"": ""They are both flowering plants."",
    ""Confidence"": 0.95
}

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states Isoplexis is ""flowering plants.""  
- While Quince isn't directly labeled ""flowering,"" its family (Rosaceae) exclusively comprises flowering plants (angiosperms), making this an inherent characteristic.  
- No other shared traits are mentioned in the context, leaving ""flowering plants"" as the only verifiable commonality.  
- Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) due to the slight inferential step for Quince, though the botanical classification is unambiguous.",They are both flowering plants.,False,True,,They are both flowering plants.,0.95,flowering plants,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa
4185_h,"{
    ""Answer"": ""Both are plants."",
    ""Confidence"": 1.0
}

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly identifies quince as a fruit in the Rosaceae family (a plant family) and Isoplexis as a section of flowering plants in the Plantaginaceae family.  
- The only unambiguous shared characteristic stated is that both belong to the plant kingdom.  
- Confidence is 1.0 because the context directly categorizes both entities as plants with no contradictory information.",Both are plants.,False,True,,Both are plants.,1.0,flowering plants,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

**Reasoning:**  
- The context states that the subject (implied to be Kevin Spacey) won his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the 1995 crime thriller ""The Usual Suspects"".  
- Gabe Turner is described as collaborating with actors including Kevin Spacey, though the context does not explicitly name Turner as working *on this specific film*.  
- Confidence is 0.85 (high) because:  
  - The film title and award year directly match the question.  
  - Spacey is listed among Turner's collaborators.  
  - Minor uncertainty exists as the context doesn't explicitly confirm Turner collaborated on *this particular project* versus other works.",The Usual Suspects,False,True,,The Usual Suspects,0.85,The Usual Suspects,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

3. Specifies they constitute 92% of China's population  
4. Uses ""Han Chinese"" interchangeably with ""Han people"" and ""Han ethnicity""  
5. Contains no mention of Mongolian Chinese in the provided context  

The confidence is 1.0 because the context provides unambiguous, directly stated evidence that:

**Explanation:**  
- **TD Securities** is explicitly described as an ""investment bank"" in the context.  
- **Wachovia Securities** includes ""investment banking subsidiaries"" under its operations, confirming its role in investment banking.  
Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) due to minor ambiguity in whether Wachovia Securities is *exclusively* an investment bank versus having broader services, though the context confirms its investment banking function exists.",yes,False,True,,yes,0.95,yes,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

**Explanation:**  
- The context directly states *""TD Securities is a Canadian investment bank""*, confirming its status.  
- For Wachovia Securities, the context identifies it as a *trade name* for services that **include** investment banking subsidiaries, but positions it primarily as a broader financial services entity (retail brokerage + capital markets). This nuanced distinction warrants slight uncertainty.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) due to explicit definitions, with minor reservation for potential interpretation of Wachovia's subsidiary structure.","TD Securities is explicitly described as an investment bank.

  • The disbanding in 1997 refers to Roberts' unnamed band, not Bikini Kill.

This directly answers both parts of the question: his role as an actor in the film and his identity as a political activist.

Explanation:  
- The context states that Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio scored the winning goal in the match referenced (2005–06 DFB-Pokal final).  
- His full name is provided as ""Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio"", where ""Miguel"" is a middle name and ""Pizarro"" is typically considered a surname. However, the question specifically asks for ""two middle names"".  
- In Hispanic naming conventions, ""Miguel"" is a middle name, and ""Pizarro"" is the paternal surname. Since the question explicitly requests ""two middle names"", the answer combines ""Miguel"" and ""Pizarro"" as they appear sequentially after the first name in the given context.  
- Confidence is 0.7 because:  
  - The context clearly identifies Claudio Pizarro as the goal-scorer.  
  - The name structure in the text (""Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio"") supports ""Miguel Pizarro"" as the immediate names following the first name.  
  - However, cultural naming norms might interpret ""Pizarro"" as a surname rather than a middle name, introducing mild ambiguity.

- Lucille Bremer performed this song in the 1946 film *Ziegfeld Follies*, confirming the link between the song, the year, and her dancing.

While Ruzowitzky may have some American projects, Kagan's career is fundamentally rooted in the U.S. industry as a director, screenwriter, and producer. This strongly implies Kagan has more American film credits, though the exact counts aren't provided.

- Jeremy Kagan is explicitly identified as an American filmmaker with credits spanning film, television, directing, screenwriting, and producing. His career started earlier (1945 birth year) and likely includes extensive U.S.-based projects.  
- Stefan Ruzowitzky is Austrian, and while he may have some American credits, his primary work is European (e.g., Oscar-winning *The Counterfeiters*).

- David Seltzer is **American**, and the contiguous United States shares an 8,891 km border with Canada. Even the farthest US point (e.g., California) is closer to Canada than Munich.

**Confidence Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states Neil Finn recorded the 1998 single.  
- Aaron Sorkin is confirmed as the screenwriter of *The Social Network* and creator of *Sports Night* where the song was featured.  
- Confidence is reduced slightly (0.95) due to potential ambiguity in pronoun references (""he"" could momentarily confuse Finn/Sorkin roles), but the core facts are unambiguous.","Neil Finn recorded the song 'She Will Have Her Way' released in 1998, which was featured in Aaron Sorkin's show 'Sports Night'.

- *Aladdin* (1992) is Disney's 31st animated feature and the fourth film of the Disney Renaissance era, matching the timeline.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) because:  
  1. The studio's involvement aligns with the uncredited work described.

**Explanation:**

- In contrast, Gene Saks (implied by ""his"" in the latter sentences) is highlighted for theater achievements: Broadway debut, Tony Awards for directing plays, and induction into the American Theater Hall of Fame.  
- The pronoun shift (""his"") confirms the second part refers to Gene Saks, whose theater work overshadows any film recognition in the given context.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) due to explicit film-focused phrasing for Amanda versus theater-focused accolades for Gene, with minor uncertainty only from contextual pronoun ambiguity.",Amanda Lovejoy Street,False,True,,Amanda Lovejoy Street,0.95,Amanda Lovejoy Street,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

Explanation:
- The context explicitly states that the Australian Open is ""chronologically the first of the four Grand Slam tennis events of the year"" and was ""first held in 1905.""
- Since the US Open is the final major in the calendar, the Australian Open (1905) is the first major held before it each year.
- Confidence is 0.8 (not 1.0) because the context doesn't provide start dates for Wimbledon (1877) or the French Open (1891), which are older tournaments. However, the question specifically references the Grand Slam sequence, and the context designates the Australian Open as the first in that sequence.",1905 (Australian Open),False,True,,1905 (Australian Open),0.8,1905,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

1. The context directly links ""he"" to the Dan Conner role.

**Reasoning:**  
The context explicitly lists Huxley's professions as ""writer, novelist, philosopher, and prominent member of the Huxley family"" (4 distinct roles), while Carver is described as a ""short-story writer and poet"" (2 roles). This indicates Huxley had broader professional scope.

- The context explicitly states Putnam's marriage to Amelia Earhart.  
- Historical records confirm Earhart as the first woman to solo the Atlantic (1932).

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states Sansha administers multiple island groups (Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, etc.), indicating it comprises numerous islands.  
- Xingning is described solely as a land-based city with area/population metrics, with no mention of islands.  
- Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) due to the *remote possibility* of unmentioned islands in Xingning, though the context strongly implies Sansha is island-centric while Xingning is not.","No, Sansha contains more islands than Xingning, Guangdong.",False,True,,"No, Sansha contains more islands than Xingning, Guangdong.",0.95,yes,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

- Calendula is native to ""southwestern Asia, western Europe, Macaronesia, and the Mediterranean""  

The confidence is 0.98 (not 1.0) because:

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states:  
- ""The Southern Baptist Convention [...] is the largest non-Catholic Christian denomination in the United States""  
- Russell D. Moore is described as an evangelical theologian and ethicist, and historically served as president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC), which is the policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC).  

While Moore headed the ERLC (a subsidiary entity), the denomination itself is the SBC. The question’s phrasing (""denomination headed by"") is slightly ambiguous, but the SBC is the core organization. Confidence is 0.95 because:  
- The context directly names the SBC as the denomination.  
- Moore’s leadership role in the ERLC ties him to the SBC structure.  
- Minor ambiguity exists in whether ""headed"" refers to the denomination or its subsidiary, but the SBC is the unambiguous answer for the denomination.",Southern Baptist Convention,False,True,,Southern Baptist Convention,0.95,The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states: ""James Wan (born 27 February 1977)"" and identifies him as the director of *Insidious*.  
- This is a directly stated fact with no ambiguity.  
- Confidence is 1.0 because the answer is explicitly provided in the context.",James Wan was born on 27 February 1977.,False,True,,James Wan was born on 27 February 1977.,1.0,27 February 1977,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa

}

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states: ""In 2008 it became the biggest youth party political organisation in Denmark"" and immediately identifies ""it"" as the Socialist People's Party (SF). There is no mention of ""The Youth Green Party"" in the context, making the provided example response incorrect. The confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) due to minor ambiguity in whether ""it"" refers directly to SF or its youth wing, though the phrasing strongly implies SF itself.","The Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti, SF)",False,True,,"The Socialist People's Party (Socialistisk Folkeparti, SF)",0.95,Socialist People's Party,deepseek_r1,halu_eval_qa
