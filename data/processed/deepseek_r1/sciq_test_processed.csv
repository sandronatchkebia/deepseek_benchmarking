Gametogenesis is the biological process of producing gametes, which are the sex cells involved in reproduction. Meiosis is a key step in gametogenesis, reducing chromosome number to create haploid cells. Gametes include both sperm (male) and eggs (female), so option A is correct.

103,"### Reasoning:
The question asks what indicates the number of atoms in a compound, referring to chemical notation. In chemical formulas, subscripts (indices) directly denote the atom count, such as the ""2"" in H₂O. Prefixes like ""di-"" are used in naming covalent compounds but not in the formula itself. Suffixes and digits are not standard for this purpose; suffixes modify word endings (e.g., ""-ide""), and digits are numerical symbols without positional context. Thus, indices are the correct term, with high confidence due to standard chemistry education.

307,"### Reasoning:
The question emphasizes that formal charge is a bookkeeping method, not the real charge on an atom. Formal charge helps assign electron distribution in Lewis structures but ignores factors like electronegativity, so it doesn't reflect actual charges (e.g., partial charges in polar bonds). Isotopes, negative charges, and electron bonds are unrelated; isotopes affect mass, negative charges are a subset of actual charges, and bonds are structural, not charge-based. Thus, B is correct with high confidence.

The question asks for the type of chemical reaction that releases energy. Exothermic reactions are specifically defined as those that release energy, such as combustion. Endothermic reactions absorb energy, making option C incorrect. Sulfuric reactions (A) refer to processes involving sulfuric acid but are not a standard category for energy release.

391,"**Reasoning:** Birds are the most recent vertebrate class to evolve, originating from theropod dinosaurs about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period. While bony fishes are the most abundant vertebrates in terms of biomass and numbers, they evolved much earlier (~420 million years ago). Birds, however, are highly diverse and widespread, with over 10,000 species, making them relatively abundant but not the most. The question combines both criteria, but birds best satisfy the ""most recent"" aspect, which is definitive, while abundance is secondary. Confidence is moderate (60%) due to the tension between the two criteria.

**Answer:** C

Sexual reproduction generates the most genetic variation through processes like meiosis, crossing over, and random fertilization, creating diverse offspring essential for evolutionary adaptation. Asexual reproduction (including cloning) produces genetically identical offspring with minimal variation. Synthetic reproduction is not a standard biological concept and is irrelevant here. I am highly confident in this, as it is a core principle in biology.

The question asks for the disease-causing microorganisms carried by a vector, such as a mosquito. ""Pathogen"" specifically refers to microorganisms that cause disease, making it the precise term. ""Microbe"" is broader and includes non-pathogenic organisms, so it's less accurate. ""Genome"" is unrelated, as it denotes genetic material, not an organism.

Cell membranes are selectively permeable, and a well-established example is their permeability to gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide.
