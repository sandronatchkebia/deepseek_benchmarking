    ""Reasoning"": ""The most appropriate estimate for an individual's lifespan, given no other information beyond being an American male from birth, is to use the average life expectancy for that demographic. As of recent data (e.g., 2022), the life expectancy for males in the United States is approximately 74.8 years. Rounding this to the nearest integer gives 75 years. However, individual lifespans are subject to significant variation due to genetics, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and unforeseen events. While 75 is the best central estimate, the actual age of death for any given individual can deviate substantially from this average. Therefore, the probability that the true age at death will fall within a narrow range of +/- 1 year around this average is relatively low, reflecting the broad distribution of lifespans."",

According to the Social Security Administration's Period Life Table for 2021 (the most recent available detailed data), the remaining life expectancy for an American female at age 87 is approximately 4.75 years. Therefore, the estimated total lifespan would be 87 + 4.75 = 91.75 years. Rounding to the nearest whole number, the best estimate is 92 years. 

To determine confidence, if the estimated answer is 92, 'within 5 years' means the true age at death falls within the range of 92 - 5 = 87 years and 92 + 5 = 97 years (inclusive). Using the same SSA 2021 Period Life Table, the number of females alive at age 87 (lx_87) is 43,158 out of 100,000 births, and the number of females alive at age 97 (lx_97) is 12,028. The number of females who die between age 87 and just before reaching age 97 (i.e., within the range [87, 96]) is lx_87 - lx_97 = 43,158 - 12,028 = 31,130. The probability of an 87-year-old female dying within this range is 31,130 / 43,158 ≈ 0.7214. This indicates that about 72.1% of American females who live to 87 will die before reaching 97, which corresponds to the true age falling within the specified 5-year window around the estimate.",92,0.72,92.83,gemini-2.5-flash,life_eval
