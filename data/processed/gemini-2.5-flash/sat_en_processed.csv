The experiment then made half the plants 'more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs' into their flowers. The result was 'double the normal number of beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.' This directly indicates that the increased dimethoxybenzene attracted more beetles, thus inferring they are attracted to the same compound as squash bees.",D,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.85,D,gemini-2.5-flash,sat_en
