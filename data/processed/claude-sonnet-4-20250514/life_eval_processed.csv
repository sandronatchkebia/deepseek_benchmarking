    ""Reasoning"": ""For an American male at birth (age 0), I need to consider current life expectancy statistics. According to recent CDC data, life expectancy for American males is approximately 76-77 years. However, predicting an exact age of death for any individual has enormous uncertainty due to countless variables including genetics, lifestyle, accidents, disease, socioeconomic factors, and medical advances. Even population-level statistics have standard deviations of several years. Asking for certainty within 1 year of the true value for a specific individual is extremely difficult - this would require knowing the exact age at death, which is essentially impossible to predict accurately for any given person."",

According to recent CDC data, life expectancy for American males is approximately 76-77 years. However, this is an average that includes infant mortality and deaths at all ages. Since the question asks about someone who has 'lived at least 0 years' (essentially at birth), I should use the standard life expectancy figure. There's significant variation in individual lifespans due to genetics, lifestyle, socioeconomic factors, and random events. While 76-77 is the statistical average, individual outcomes can vary widely - some will die much younger due to accidents, disease, or other factors, while others will live well into their 80s or 90s.
