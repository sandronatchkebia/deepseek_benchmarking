""Reasoning"": ""Short period comets (orbital periods less than 200 years) originate from the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. This is well-established astronomical knowledge. The Kuiper Belt contains remnants from the solar system's formation that occasionally get perturbed into the inner solar system. The other options are incorrect: the Milky Way is our galaxy, Vesta Belt isn't a recognized astronomical term, and photon belt is pseudoscientific."",
