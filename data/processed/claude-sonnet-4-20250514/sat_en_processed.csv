5,"Looking at the passage, I need to identify why the authors mention X-ray evidence and density in lines 16-19.

The passage states: ""It has often been assumed that since there was only one chain in the chemical formula there would only be one in the structural unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.""

The context shows that the authors are addressing a discrepancy between what was previously assumed (one chain based on chemical formula) and what their structural analysis reveals (two chains). The X-ray evidence and density measurements are presented as supporting evidence for their claim that DNA consists of two chains, not one.

This directly contradicts the previous assumption and provides empirical support for their two-chain model. The authors are not discussing genetic information (A), nucleotide composition (B), or confirming a relationship between density and chemical formula (D). Instead, they're using physical evidence to support their structural claim.

{

6,"Looking at this question, I need to identify which bases are purines and then find their percentages in yeast DNA from the table.

From the passage, I can see that ""Two of the possible bases—adenine and guanine—are purines, and the other two—thymine and cytosine—are pyrimidines.""

So the purines are:
- Adenine 
- Guanine

Looking at the table for yeast DNA:
- Adenine: 31.3%
- Guanine: 18.7%
- Cytosine: 17.1%
- Thymine: 32.9%

Therefore, the purines in yeast DNA are adenine (31.3%) and guanine (18.7%).

Looking at the answer choices, option C gives ""18.7% and 31.3%"" which matches the percentages for guanine and adenine respectively.

{
""Reasoning"": ""The passage states that adenine and guanine are purines. From the table, yeast DNA contains 31.3% adenine and 18.7% guanine. Option C lists these two percentages (18.7% and 31.3%), making it the correct answer."",

7,"Looking at this question, I need to determine if the data supports the authors' proposed base pairing (adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine) and analyze the reasoning in each option.

From the passage, the authors propose that ""the only pairs of bases possible are: adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine."" If this pairing is correct, we would expect roughly equal percentages of A-T and G-C in each organism's DNA.

Examining the table data:
- For every organism listed, adenine percentages are indeed very close to thymine percentages
- Similarly, guanine percentages are very close to cytosine percentages
- For example, in humans: A=29.3%, T=30.0%, G=20.7%, C=20.0%

This pattern strongly supports the proposed base pairing model.

Now analyzing the options:
- Options A and C both correctly identify that A≈T and G≈C in the data
- Options B and D incorrectly claim A≈G and C≈T, which contradicts the actual data
- The key difference is whether this supports (A) or contradicts (C) the authors' proposal

Since the A≈T and G≈C pattern directly confirms the authors' proposed pairing, the data clearly supports their model.

{
""Reasoning"": ""The authors propose adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine. The table data consistently shows adenine percentages closely match thymine percentages, and guanine percentages closely match cytosine percentages across all organisms. This pattern directly supports the proposed base pairing model."",

8,"Looking at this question, I need to understand what ""the previous question"" was asking about. Based on the passage and the nature of this question, the previous question likely asked about base pairing rules in DNA.

From the passage, we learn that bases pair specifically: adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine. This means that in any DNA sample, the percentage of adenine should equal the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine should equal the percentage of cytosine.

Looking at the sea urchin data from the table:
- Adenine: 32.8%
- Guanine: 17.7%
- Cytosine: 17.3%
- Thymine: 32.1%

According to base pairing rules, we should see:
- Adenine (32.8%) ≈ Thymine (32.1%) - these are very close
- Guanine (17.7%) ≈ Cytosine (17.3%) - these are very close

The question asks which pair of percentages provides evidence for base pairing. Option A shows cytosine (17.3%) and guanine (17.7%), which should be equal according to the base pairing rule and are indeed very close in value.

{
""Reasoning"": ""The passage describes DNA base pairing rules where guanine pairs with cytosine. In sea urchin DNA, cytosine is 17.3% and guanine is 17.7% - these nearly equal percentages support the complementary base pairing principle described in the passage."",

He emphasizes that ""God himself...placed in every human heart the love of liberty"" and that no race ""would welcome a foreign master.""

Bryan directly states that ""the subject races"" would ""protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability."" He argues this resistance is natural and inevitable, citing historical examples of American leaders who fought against foreign rule.

Beveridge's vision in Passage 1 presents an optimistic picture of Americans bringing civilization and prosperity to these territories, seemingly assuming the islanders would welcome or accept American governance. Bryan would view this as naive because it fails to account for the natural human desire for self-governance and the inevitable resistance that would follow.

The other options don't align with Bryan's main arguments: he doesn't focus on Americans' unwillingness to relocate (A), economic motives (B), or resource distribution (C). His core criticism is about the fundamental human rejection of foreign rule.

The key phrase is that light exposure ""induce[s] seed germination"" and that photon exposure below a certain threshold is ""below the threshold needed to stimulate the germination of most seeds.""

The passage begins with Lymie sitting alone in the restaurant, reading his history book about the Peace of Paris and the Congress of Vienna. The narrative follows his reading experience in detail - how he eats while reading, counts historical figures on his fingers, and gets distracted by other patrons.

Then the focus shifts to describing the party of four that enters (two men and two women with their appearance and behavior), followed by an extended description of Mr. Peters (Lymie's father) - his physical appearance, decline, and personality traits.

While the passage does include some physical setting details early on, the primary movement is from Lymie's solitary reading experience to detailed character descriptions of the restaurant patrons and his father. The narrative doesn't focus on inner thoughts of other characters, nor does it show relationship development, nor does it primarily shift from setting to personality traits.

124,"Looking at this question, I need to identify which claim can be directly supported by data presented in the passage that could reasonably be shown in a graph.

Let me examine each option:

A) The passage states: ""Between 1960 and 2010, the median city in high-income countries grew modestly from 500,000 to 650,000 people; but the median city in the developing world nearly quadrupled, expanding from 220,000 to 845,000 people."" This provides specific numerical data showing developing countries' cities grew from 220,000 to 845,000 (a 284% increase) while high-income countries grew from 500,000 to 650,000 (a 30% increase). This data could easily be graphed and clearly supports the claim.

B) The passage states ""In 1960, 12 of the top 20 countries with the largest average city size were high-income countries."" Since 12 out of 20 is 60%, this is more than half, making this claim accurate and graphable.

C) While the passage mentions these correlations, it presents them as research findings rather than direct causal relationships that would be clearly demonstrated in a simple graph.

D) This is a conclusion/recommendation from the research rather than raw data that would typically be graphed.

Both A and B have strong numerical support, but A provides the most concrete, comparative data that would make for a compelling graph showing the dramatic difference in growth rates between the two types of countries.

139,"Looking at this question, I need to identify what the passage suggests about the model proposed by astronomers (Bottke and colleagues) and how it would apply to type C asteroids.

The key points from the passage are:
1. Bottke's model suggests iron meteorite parent bodies formed closer to the Sun
2. These differentiated bodies were disrupted by collisions in the inner solar system
3. Iron fragments survived better and were scattered to the asteroid belt
4. Later, primitive meteorite parent bodies formed in the asteroid belt and mostly survived

While I don't have the referenced table, the passage indicates that primitive asteroids (which would include type C asteroids - the most common primitive asteroids) formed later in the asteroid belt after the iron fragments had already arrived.

According to Bottke's model:
- Iron meteorite parents (type M asteroids) formed early, closer to the Sun
- Primitive asteroids (type C) formed later, directly in the asteroid belt

This temporal sequence means type C asteroids would be younger than type M asteroids under this model.
