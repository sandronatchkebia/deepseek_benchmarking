0,"Looking at this logic puzzle, I need to check each option against the given constraints:

1. George can only give a report on Tuesday
2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon reports
3. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day (unless Nina reports on Wednesday)

Let me analyze each option:

**Option A**: Robert is scheduled for Monday afternoon, violating constraint 2 (Robert cannot give afternoon reports).

**Option B**: Olivia is scheduled for Monday afternoon, violating constraint 2 (Olivia cannot give afternoon reports).

**Option C**: 
- George reports Tuesday morning ✓
- Neither Olivia nor Robert in afternoon slots ✓
- No Nina, so constraint 3 doesn't apply ✓
- All constraints satisfied!

**Option D**: Robert is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, violating constraint 2.

**Option E**: 
- George reports Wednesday afternoon, violating constraint 1 (George can only report on Tuesday)
- Nina reports Monday afternoon, violating constraint 2 (Olivia cannot give afternoon reports - wait, this is Nina, so this part is okay)
- But Nina reports Monday, so Helen and Irving must both report Tuesday. Only Irving reports Tuesday, not Helen, violating constraint 3.

Only Option C satisfies all constraints.

21,"Looking at this logic puzzle, I need to work through the constraints systematically.

Given constraints:
- Greyhounds on day 1
- No breed on consecutive days
- No breed on both day 1 and day 7
- Himalayans on exactly 3 days, but not day 1
- Rottweilers not on day 7 or any Himalayan day
- Additional condition: Himalayans not on day 7

Since Himalayans can't be on days 1 or 7, and need exactly 3 days, they must be on 3 of days {2,3,4,5,6}.

Since Rottweilers can't be with Himalayans or on day 7, and Greyhounds are on day 1, the puppy distribution becomes constrained.

Let me check if day 1 and day 3 can have the same kitten-puppy combination:

Day 1: Must have Greyhound (given), and since Himalayans aren't on day 1, it's either Manx or Siamese.

If day 1 has Manx-Greyhound, then for day 3 to match:
- Day 3 would need Manx-Greyhound
- But Greyhounds can't be on consecutive days, and if Himalayans are on day 2, then day 3 can't have Greyhounds (since no breed repeats consecutively)
- This creates conflicts with the constraint patterns

Working through the possible arrangements, I find that having the same breed combination on days 1 and 3 consistently violates the consecutive day restrictions when combined with the Himalayan placement requirements.

The other pairs (B, C, D, E) can potentially work in various valid arrangements without creating logical contradictions.

Given constraints:
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane
- Exactly two students review exactly the same play(s) as each other

Let me analyze each option:

Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, neither can review only Sunset (eliminating options B and D).

For option A (Lopez only): If Lopez reviews only Sunset, then Megregian must review more plays than Lopez (at least 2). Since Megregian can't review Sunset (same as Lopez), Megregian could review Tamerlane and Undulation. This could work.

For option C (Jiang, Lopez only Sunset): This violates the constraint that Lopez and Megregian can't review any play Jiang reviews, since both Jiang and Lopez would review Sunset.

For option E (Lopez, Megregian only Sunset): This violates the constraint that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, since they'd both review exactly one play.

Testing option A more thoroughly: If Lopez reviews only Sunset, Megregian could review Tamerlane and Undulation (2 plays > Lopez's 1). Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Kramer could review fewer plays than Megregian by reviewing only Tamerlane. Jiang could review Undulation only. This satisfies all constraints, with Kramer and O'Neill being the pair who review the same plays.

- Nessa must lead an afternoon session
- Julio's session must meet earlier in the week than Olivia's

- Julio must be before Olivia, and Olivia can't be same day as Lan

- Nessa (in scenario 1, she must lead Thursday afternoon)
- Rebecca (in scenario 2, when Kevin is Thursday morning)
- Kevin (in scenario 2, if he takes Thursday afternoon slot)
- Julio (possible in both scenarios depending on arrangement)

Lan and Olivia face more restrictions due to their constraint with each other and Julio's precedence requirement.

Let me analyze the key constraints:
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2  
- Parra and Quinn work in the same zone
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone
- Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2

From the first two constraints, I can derive the possible scenarios:
1. If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is not in Zone 1, so Tiao must be in Zone 2, which means Udall is not in Zone 2
2. If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is not in Zone 1, and Udall must be in Zone 2

Let me check option E: ""Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1""

If this were true, then:
- Parra is in Zone 1, so Tiao must be in Zone 2 (from constraint 1)
- Since Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall cannot be in Zone 2 (from constraint 2)
- Since Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone, and Stuckey is in Zone 1, Udall must also be in Zone 1
- Quinn must be with Parra in Zone 1
- This gives us Zone 1: Parra, Stuckey, Udall, Quinn (4 people)
- Zone 2: Tiao (1 person)
- Zone 3: Kim, Mahr (2 people)

But this violates the constraint that Zone 3 must have more representatives than Zone 2. Zone 3 has 2 and Zone 2 has 1, so Zone 3 does have more than Zone 2. Wait, let me reconsider...

93,"Looking at this logic puzzle, I need to analyze the constraints and determine which pair cannot be shown consecutively.

Given constraints:
- J must be shown in the evening (positions 6 or 7)
- K cannot be shown in the morning (positions 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7)
- L must be shown after K and before M (K < L < M in sequence)

Let me examine each option:

For option A (J, K): Since J is in evening (6 or 7) and K can be in positions 3-7, they could be consecutive if both are in evening (positions 6-7).

For option B (J, M): J is in evening, M could potentially be in evening too, so they might be consecutive.

For option C (J, O): J is in evening, O has no restrictions, so they could be consecutive in evening.

For option D (J, P): J is in evening, P has no restrictions, so they could be consecutive in evening.

For option E (M, P): The key insight is the constraint K < L < M. This means M needs at least 2 positions before it (for K and L). If M and P are consecutive in evening (positions 6-7), then M would be in position 6. But then K and L would need to fit in positions 3-5, which works. However, if we examine this more carefully with the morning constraint on K, the positioning becomes very restrictive.

Actually, let me reconsider option A more carefully. If J and K are consecutive, given that J must be in evening and K cannot be in morning, they could only be consecutive in positions 6-7. But this severely limits where L and M can go, given that L must come after K and before M.

After careful analysis, the constraint K < L < M creates the most restrictive scenario. If K is in position 6 or 7 (evening), then L and M must both come after K, but there may not be enough positions.

{

A) K after J: Since J is in evening (6-7) and K can be in positions 3-7, this is possible if J is in position 6 and K is in position 7.

B) L after J: If J is in position 6, L could be in position 7, but then we need K < L < M. This would require K before position 6 and M after position 7, which is impossible.

C) P after J: If J is in position 6, P could be in position 7. No constraints prevent this.

D) Both N and O after M: This would require M in positions 1-5 and both N and O in later positions. Given the K < L < M constraint, this seems feasible.

E) Both N and P after K: Since K can be in positions 3-7, having both N and P after K is possible in various arrangements.

110,"Looking at this logic puzzle, I need to work through the constraints systematically when G is fourth.

Given constraints:
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third
- S must be earlier than Y
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R

Since G is fourth:
- J must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (before G)
- R must be in positions 5, 6, or 7 (after G)

Let me check each option:

A) H is fifth: Since G (finance) is fourth and H (finance) would be fifth, this violates the ""no consecutive same topics"" rule.

B) J is first: This satisfies J before G. Let me try to construct a valid sequence:
Position 1: J (finance), Position 4: G (finance)
I need to place H, Q, R, S, Y in positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 with all constraints satisfied.

C) Q is second: For S to be before Q, Q must be third (given constraint). If Q is second, S cannot be before Q while satisfying this rule.

D) S is fifth: Since G (finance) is fourth, S (nutrition) fifth works for the consecutive rule. Need to verify other constraints can be satisfied.

E) Y is sixth: This could work if S is placed before position 6.

Testing option B more carefully:
If J is first and G is fourth, I can construct: J(1), S(2), Q(3), G(4), R(5), Y(6), H(7)
This satisfies: J<G<R, S<Q with Q third, S<Y, and no consecutive same topics.

Testing option D:
If G is fourth and S is fifth, with R needing to be after G, this creates challenges fitting all constraints while avoiding consecutive same topics.

Option B appears most viable as it allows a complete valid arrangement.

Given constraints:
- No consecutive articles can cover the same topic
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third
- S must be earlier than Y
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R

Let me test option B) H is second:

If H is second, I need to construct a valid sequence. Since H (finance) is second, positions 1 and 3 cannot be finance articles.

From the constraints, I know J < G < R. Let me try placing J first:
- Position 1: J (finance)
- Position 2: H (finance) ✗ - This violates the ""no consecutive same topic"" rule

Let me try a different approach with H second:
- Position 1: S (nutrition)
- Position 2: H (finance)
- Position 3: Q (nutrition) - This satisfies ""S earlier than Q only if Q is third""

Continuing this sequence:
- Position 4: J (finance) - satisfies J < G
- Position 5: Y (wildlife) - satisfies S < Y
- Position 6: G (finance) - satisfies J < G < R
- Position 7: R (nutrition) - satisfies G < R

Checking: S-H-Q-J-Y-G-R
- No consecutive same topics ✓
- S < Q with Q third ✓
- S < Y ✓
- J < G < R ✓

This works! Let me quickly verify the other options are impossible due to constraint violations.

**Vegemite in slot 1**: This works because Vegemite only needs to be before Zircon, and there are slots 2-6 available for the remaining bands including Zircon.

**Wellspring in slot 1**: This works because Wellspring only needs to be before Xpert, and slots 2-6 are available for other bands.

**Yardsign in slot 1**: This works because Yardsign can be in slots 1-3, and slot 1 satisfies this constraint.

**Zircon in slot 1**: This cannot work because both Vegemite and Wellspring must come before Xpert, and Vegemite must come before Zircon. If Zircon is in slot 1, there's no earlier slot for Vegemite.

- Exactly 3 lectures in Gladwyn Hall (so 2 in Howard)
- Sandpipers: Howard Auditorium, before oystercatchers
- Terns before petrels, petrels in Gladwyn Hall

Since exactly 3 lectures are in Gladwyn and we know positions 1 and 4 are Gladwyn and Howard respectively, I need to determine positions 2, 3, and 5.

We know Howard has exactly 2 lectures: position 4 and one other position (2, 3, or 5).
We know sandpipers is in Howard, so sandpipers must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

Let me check option B: ""The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.""

If both positions 2 and 3 were in Howard, then Howard would have positions 2, 3, and 4 (three lectures total). But the constraint states exactly 3 lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, meaning only 2 can be in Howard Auditorium. This creates a contradiction.

Therefore, it's impossible for both the second and third lectures to be in Howard Auditorium.

Let me verify other options could be possible:

Given constraints:
- 1st lecture: Gladwyn Hall
- 4th lecture: Howard Auditorium  
- Exactly 3 lectures in Gladwyn Hall (so 2nd, 3rd, and 5th must include 2 more Gladwyn lectures)
- Sandpipers: Howard Auditorium, before oystercatchers
- Terns before petrels, petrels in Gladwyn Hall

Since petrels must be in Gladwyn Hall and terns must come before petrels, I need to determine possible positions.

If petrels are in position 2 (Gladwyn), terns must be in position 1 (Gladwyn). This leaves sandpipers for position 4 (Howard), which satisfies the constraint that sandpipers come before oystercatchers. The remaining positions would be rails in position 3 and oystercatchers in position 5.

Let me check if this works:
- Position 1: Terns (Gladwyn) ✓
- Position 2: Petrels (Gladwyn) ✓  
- Position 3: Rails (must be Howard to have exactly 3 in Gladwyn)
- Position 4: Sandpipers (Howard) ✓
- Position 5: Oystercatchers (Gladwyn) ✓

This satisfies all constraints: exactly 3 in Gladwyn (positions 1, 2, 5), sandpipers before oystercatchers (4 < 5), and terns before petrels (1 < 2).

- 4th lecture: Howard Auditorium  
- Exactly 3 lectures in Gladwyn Hall (so positions 1, and two others)
- Sandpipers: Howard Auditorium, before oystercatchers
- Terns before petrels, petrels in Gladwyn Hall

If the 3rd lecture is on sandpipers:
- Position 3: Sandpipers, Howard Auditorium
- Since exactly 3 lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, and we have positions 1 and 4 fixed as Gladwyn and Howard respectively, the remaining Gladwyn positions must be 2 and 5.

So the venue pattern is: G-G-H-H-G

Now checking each option:

A) 2nd on oystercatchers in Gladwyn: This violates the constraint that sandpipers (3rd) comes before oystercatchers.

B) 5th on oystercatchers in Howard: This violates our deduced venue pattern (5th must be Gladwyn).

C) 2nd on rails in Howard: This violates our deduced venue pattern (2nd must be Gladwyn).

D) 2nd on terns in Gladwyn: This works! Terns (2nd) comes before petrels, and petrels could be in 5th position (Gladwyn Hall), satisfying all constraints.

E) 4th on terns in Howard: If terns are 4th, petrels must be 5th (in Gladwyn). But then oystercatchers must come after sandpipers (3rd), leaving only position 2. However, position 2 must be Gladwyn, and we'd need rails somewhere, creating scheduling conflicts.

From the constraints:
- Hue's photos in Lifestyle = Fuentes' photos in Sports
- Since Hue has 1 photo in Lifestyle, Fuentes must have 1 photo in Sports
- Gagnon cannot be in Sports, so the other Sports photo must be by Hue
- Therefore: Sports section has 1 Fuentes photo and 1 Hue photo

Current count:
- Fuentes: 1 photo (Sports)
- Gagnon: 1 photo (Lifestyle)

- Fuentes needs 0-2 more photos
- Gagnon needs 0-2 more photos  
- Hue needs 0-1 more photos

The constraint ""at least one photograph in Lifestyle must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro"" is satisfied by either Gagnon or Hue being in Metro.

A) Both Lifestyle photos by Fuentes: This would give Fuentes 3 photos total (1 Metro + 2 Lifestyle), leaving Sports to Hue and Gagnon.

Wait, if Fuentes has 2 in Lifestyle, then Sports must have 2 Hue photos, making Hue's Lifestyle (0) ≠ Fuentes' Sports (0). Actually, this works: 0 = 0.

B) Both Lifestyle photos by Gagnon: This satisfies the Metro connection constraint since we need at least one Lifestyle photo by Fuentes or Hue, but this violates it.

C) One Lifestyle by Gagnon, one by Hue: This gives Hue 1 Lifestyle photo. For the constraint, Fuentes must have 1 Sports photo, leaving 1 Sports photo for Hue (since Gagnon can't be in Sports). This works.

D) Both Lifestyle photos by Hue: Hue would have 2 Lifestyle photos, so Fuentes needs 2 Sports photos. This leaves 0 Sports photos for others, which works since Gagnon can't be in Sports.

E) Both Sports photos by Fuentes: This means Fuentes has 3 total photos. For the constraint to work, Hue needs 0 Lifestyle photos, but then who takes the Lifestyle photos? Only Gagnon is left, giving option B, which we saw doesn't work.

Since Grecia and Louise can't work the same day, and Grecia needs two nonconsecutive days for first shifts, I need to check which arrangements work.

If Louise works second shifts on consecutive days, those days are blocked for Grecia. For Grecia to have two nonconsecutive first shift days, she needs at least 3 available days with a gap between her chosen days.

- Grecia can't work Mon or Tue
- Available for Grecia: Wed, Thu, Fri (first shifts)
- Grecia could work Wed-Fri (nonconsecutive) ✓

Testing Louise on Tue-Wed (second shifts):

Given information:

- Grecia and Louise never work the same day

Since Katya works Tuesday second shift, someone else must work Tuesday first shift. Given that Grecia and Louise can't work the same day, and we need to satisfy all constraints, let me work through the possibilities.

For Louise's two consecutive second shifts, the possible pairs are: Mon-Tue, Tue-Wed, Wed-Thu, or Thu-Fri. Since Katya already works Tuesday second shift, Louise can't work Tue-Wed. 

If Louise works Mon-Tue second shifts, this conflicts with Katya on Tuesday. So Louise must work either Wed-Thu or Thu-Fri second shifts.

For Grecia's two nonconsecutive first shifts, possible combinations include Mon-Wed, Mon-Thu, Mon-Fri, Tue-Thu, Tue-Fri, or Wed-Fri.

Testing option A: If Grecia works first shift Monday, this could work with Louise working consecutive second shifts Wed-Thu or Thu-Fri, keeping them on different days.

Given constraints:
1. Sundial not on June 1st
2. If harmonica before lamp, then mirror before lamp
3. Sundial before mirror AND sundial before vase
4. Table before harmonica OR table before vase, but not both

The question adds: Table is after both mirror and vase.

From constraint 4 with the new condition: Since table is after vase, table cannot be before vase. Therefore, table must be before harmonica.

From constraint 3: Sundial comes before both mirror and vase.
Combined with the question condition: Sundial < Mirror < Table and Sundial < Vase < Table

So the order is: Sundial < {Mirror, Vase} < Table < Harmonica

Now checking each option:

A) Harmonica before table - This contradicts our derived order where table < harmonica.

B) Table before lamp - This is possible since lamp's position isn't fully constrained.

C) Table before sundial - This contradicts constraint 3 where sundial < mirror and sundial < vase, which with our conditions means sundial < table.

D) Mirror before vase - This could be true, but we need to check if it's necessarily true or just possible.

E) Sundial before lamp - From constraint 2, if harmonica before lamp, then mirror before lamp. Since we have sundial < mirror < table < harmonica, if harmonica < lamp, then mirror < lamp, and therefore sundial < lamp. This seems most likely to be true.

Option B appears to be the most flexible and could be true in valid arrangements.

200,"Looking at this logic puzzle, I need to analyze the constraints and test each option systematically.

Given constraints:
1. Sundial not on June 1st
2. If harmonica before lamp, then mirror before lamp
3. Sundial before mirror AND sundial before vase
4. Table before harmonica OR table before vase (but not both)

Let me test option E: Harmonica on June 2nd, vase on June 3rd.

From constraint 3: Sundial must be before both mirror and vase. Since vase is on June 3rd and sundial can't be on June 1st, sundial must be on June 2nd. But harmonica is also on June 2nd - impossible.

Testing option D: Table on June 3rd, lamp on June 4th.

From constraint 4: Since we need to place table before either harmonica or vase (not both), let's try table before vase.
- If table (June 3rd) before vase, then vase must be June 4th, 5th, or 6th
- But lamp is on June 4th, so vase could be June 5th or 6th

From constraint 3: Sundial before mirror and vase
- Sundial must be June 2nd (can't be June 1st)
- Mirror must be after sundial, so June 5th or 6th
- If vase is June 5th, mirror must be June 6th

This gives us: Sundial (June 2nd), Table (June 3rd), Lamp (June 4th), Vase (June 5th), Mirror (June 6th), Harmonica (June 1st)

Checking constraint 2: Harmonica (June 1st) before lamp (June 4th), so mirror must be before lamp. But mirror is on June 6th, after lamp - this violates the constraint.

Let me work through the key constraints:
- Juana and Olga are on different teams
- Lateefah is on the green team
- Kelly is not a facilitator
- Olga is a facilitator
- Each team has exactly one facilitator

Since Olga is a facilitator and there's one facilitator per team, the other team must have a different facilitator. Kelly cannot be a facilitator, so the other facilitator must be either Juana, Lateefah, or Mei.

Let me examine option A: ""Lateefah is a facilitator, and she is assigned to the same team as Kelly is.""

If Lateefah is a facilitator, she must be the green team's facilitator (since she's assigned to green team). For Kelly to be on the same team as Lateefah, Kelly would also be on the green team.

This would mean:
- Green team: Lateefah (facilitator), Kelly, and one other person
- Red team: Olga (facilitator) and one other person

Since Juana and Olga must be on different teams, Juana would be on the green team, making it: Lateefah, Kelly, Juana on green; Olga, Mei on red.

217,"Looking at this logic puzzle, I need to determine which constraint would have the same effect as ""T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.""

Let me first understand what the original constraint does. Since T must come before W with exactly two chapters between them, the possible positions for T are:
- T in chapter 1 → W in chapter 4
- T in chapter 2 → W in chapter 5  
- T in chapter 3 → W in chapter 6
- T in chapter 4 → W in chapter 7

The constraint ""T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1"" eliminates the first possibility, leaving T in chapters 2, 3, or 4.

Now I'll analyze each option:

A) ""U cannot be mentioned in chapter 2"" - This affects U's placement but doesn't directly constrain T's position relative to the T-W constraint.

B) ""W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4"" - If W cannot be in chapter 4, then T cannot be in chapter 1 (since T in chapter 1 would force W into chapter 4). This eliminates exactly the same T-W pairing that the original constraint eliminates.

C) ""X cannot be mentioned in chapter 6"" - This constrains X but doesn't directly affect the T-W relationship.

D) ""U must be mentioned in an earlier chapter than T"" - This creates a U-T ordering constraint but doesn't specifically eliminate T from chapter 1.

E) ""X must be mentioned in an earlier chapter than W"" - This affects X-W ordering but doesn't target the specific T-W pairing.

Option B has the same logical effect: both constraints eliminate the possibility of T being in chapter 1 and W being in chapter 4, while allowing all other valid T-W combinations.

{
""Reasoning"": ""The original constraint eliminates T from chapter 1, which prevents the T-W pairing of chapters 1-4. Option B directly prevents W from being in chapter 4, which eliminates the same T-W pairing and has identical effects on possible arrangements."",

218,"Looking at this logic puzzle, I need to check each option against the given constraints.

Key constraints:
- No wall has only watercolors
- No wall has work from only one student
- No wall has both Franz and Isaacs paintings
- Greene's watercolor is in upper position where Franz's oil is displayed
- Isaacs's oil is in lower position of wall 4

Let me check option E: Hidalgo's watercolor, Franz's oil, Greene's oil, Isaacs's oil

From the constraints, I know:
- Wall 4 lower: Isaacs's oil ✓
- Greene's watercolor must be upper where Franz's oil is lower
- Since Franz's oil is in wall 2 lower, Greene's watercolor must be wall 2 upper

This gives me:
- Wall 1: upper ?, lower Hidalgo's watercolor
- Wall 2: upper Greene's watercolor, lower Franz's oil  
- Wall 3: upper ?, lower Greene's oil
- Wall 4: upper ?, lower Isaacs's oil

For remaining paintings (Franz's watercolor, Hidalgo's oil, Isaacs's watercolor), I need to place them in upper positions of walls 1, 3, and 4.

Checking constraints:
- Wall 1: If upper is Franz's watercolor → both students represented ✓, not all watercolors ✓
- Wall 3: If upper is Hidalgo's oil → both students represented ✓, not all watercolors ✓  
- Wall 4: If upper is Isaacs's watercolor → only Isaacs ✗

This violates the ""no wall with only one student"" rule.

- Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4
- If Greene's oil is on the same wall as Franz's watercolor (the question's condition)

Let me work through the wall assignments:

Since Greene's watercolor is upper where Franz's oil is displayed, and Greene's oil is with Franz's watercolor, these two paintings (Greene's watercolor and Franz's oil) must be on a different wall from Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor.

Given that Isaacs's oil is on wall 4 (lower position), and no wall can have only one student's work, wall 4 needs another painting from a different student.

Since no wall can have both Franz and Isaacs paintings, Franz's paintings cannot be on wall 4. This means either Greene's or Hidalgo's remaining painting must be on wall 4 with Isaacs's oil.

Working through the constraints:
- Wall 4: Isaacs's oil (lower) + one other painting (upper)
- Since Greene's watercolor is already placed with Franz's oil on another wall, and Greene's oil is with Franz's watercolor on yet another wall, Hidalgo's watercolor must be the upper painting on wall 4
- This leaves Isaacs's watercolor to be placed, which must go in a lower position on one of the remaining walls
