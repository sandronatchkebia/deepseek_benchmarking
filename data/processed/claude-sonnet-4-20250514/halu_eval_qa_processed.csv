The context states that ""He was ranked 359th in the 'Sunday Times Rich List 2009' with an estimated wealth of £157 million"" and mentions that something ""was based on the novel 'The Carry-Cot' by Alexander Thynn."" While the question asks about the film ""Blue Blood"" specifically, the context doesn't explicitly mention this film title. However, it's reasonable to infer that the wealth figure refers to Alexander Thynn, the author of the novel mentioned.

2. ""The King"" (2017) is described as starring Jo In-sung and Jung Woo-sung.

Since the unnamed actor from the first sentence appeared in ""The King"" (2017), and ""The King"" stars Jo In-sung and Jung Woo-sung, the costar would be either Jo In-sung or Jung Woo-sung (whichever one is not the actor from the first sentence).

However, the context doesn't clearly identify which of these two actors is the one who appeared in ""What Happened in Bali"" and ""That Winter, the Wind Blows."" Without additional information to determine which actor is which, I cannot definitively identify the costar.

- Luculia is described as being ""currently found from the Himalayas to southern China""
- There's a mention of ""three species native to California and Baja California"" but this appears to be referring to a different plant (likely Bloomeria based on the question)

From the geographical ranges I can identify:
- Luculia: Himalayas to southern China (a vast area across Asia)
- Bloomeria (inferred): California and Baja California (a much smaller regional area)

The range from the Himalayas to southern China covers multiple countries and a much larger geographical area than California and Baja California.

From the context, I can see that:
1. The 1978 Miami Dolphins had an 11-5 record and returned to the playoffs
2. The context mentions ""The former record was equalled by the 2004 Patriots""
3. The 2004 New England Patriots season is specifically mentioned

Super Bowl XXXIX was played following the 2004 NFL season, and the New England Patriots won that Super Bowl. The context indicates that the 2004 Patriots equaled a record that was previously set, and given that the 1978 Miami Dolphins are specifically mentioned in the same context, this suggests the Patriots equaled a record held by the 1978 Miami Dolphins.

1. Adana is often sung or played in drut laya AFTER a vilambit composition in raga Darbari Kanada
2. Darbari Kanada was brought into North Indian music by Miyan Tansen

However, the question asks about a raga that is sung BEFORE Adana, which would be the reverse of what's described in the context. The context describes Adana coming after Darbari Kanada, not before it.

The context states that ""Real Madrid won 5–3 on aggregate"" and mentions the 1996-97 La Liga season (66th since establishment) that ran from August 31, 1996 to June 23, 1997. However, there's some confusion in the question as it mentions matches on August 20 and 23, 1997, which would be after the La Liga season ended on June 23, 1997. Despite this temporal inconsistency, the context clearly indicates Real Madrid won an aggregate match, so I'm reasonably confident this is the answer being sought, though the date discrepancy reduces my confidence somewhat.",Real Madrid,False,True,,,Real Madrid,claude-sonnet-4-20250514,halu_eval_qa
5537_h,"Looking at the context provided, I can see that:

1. Real Madrid won 5-3 on aggregate in some match
2. The 1996-97 La Liga season (66th since establishment) ran from August 31, 1996 to June 23, 1997

However, there's a logical inconsistency in the question. The question asks about a match played on August 20 and 23, 1997, but the 1996-97 La Liga season ended on June 23, 1997. A match in August 1997 would be part of the following season (1997-98), not the 66th season mentioned.

The context doesn't provide information about who won a specific two-leg match on those August 1997 dates. While Real Madrid is mentioned as winning 5-3 on aggregate, there's no indication this refers to the specific August 1997 match in question.

{
    ""Answer"": ""The context does not provide sufficient information to determine which team won the two-leg Spanish football match played on August 20 and 23, 1997.

The context describes ""Hancock and Joan"" as a 2008 biographical television film about the affair between Tony Hancock and Joan Le Mesurier. The mention of ""Silk"" (the BBC legal drama) appears to be describing later work by an actress (likely the one who played Joan Le Mesurier in the film), not something that would be referenced within the biographical film itself.

The context states that Broken Bells is composed of two members: Brian Burton (Danger Mouse) and James Mercer. However, for Navarone, the context only mentions it's a Dutch alternative rock band formed in 2008, without specifying the exact number of members. Since most rock bands typically have more than two members, and no information suggests Navarone is also a duo, it's reasonable to assume Navarone likely has more members than Broken Bells' two members. However, my confidence is moderate (0.7) because the exact number of Navarone members isn't explicitly stated in the context.",Navarone,False,True,,,Broken Bells,claude-sonnet-4-20250514,halu_eval_qa

The context only provides information about one person who was born in San Francisco, California and died in Pasadena, California, and another person who died in the Gulag after being arrested by the Soviets. However, the context doesn't clearly identify which person is Scott Pembroke and which is Eugeniusz Bodo, making it impossible to definitively answer whether they died in the same city.

The context states that Sam Roberts has been signed to Universal (Canada) since 2002, and mentions that ""they disbanded in 1997."" However, the context doesn't clearly identify what band disbanded in 1997 - it could be referring to Sam Roberts' band or potentially Bikini Kill, but this is ambiguous. Without clear information about when Bikini Kill disbanded, I cannot accurately answer whether Sam Roberts' signing occurred before or after that event. My confidence is very low because the context doesn't provide sufficient information to make this comparison.",I cannot determine when Sam Roberts was signed to Universal (Canada) relative to Bikini Kill's disbanding,False,True,,,After,claude-sonnet-4-20250514,halu_eval_qa

9833_h,"Looking at the context provided, I can see that Claudio Pizarro scored the goal that helped FC Bayern Munich defeat Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal final. However, the question asks about the match against Werder Bremen, which according to the context was won by Bayern Munich by five points in the Bundesliga - this suggests a league victory rather than a single match with a specific goal scorer.

The context does provide Claudio Pizarro's full name as ""Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio,"" which shows his middle names are ""Miguel"" and potentially ""Pizarro"" (though ""Pizarro"" appears to be his paternal surname in the Hispanic naming convention, with ""Bosio"" being his maternal surname).

However, there's ambiguity in the question since it's unclear if Pizarro was specifically the decisive player in the Werder Bremen victory, as the context only mentions he scored in the DFB-Pokal final against Eintracht Frankfurt.

The context clearly states that Sawyer International Airport is located 17 nautical miles south of Marquette's central business district. While Burlington International Airport is mentioned as being 3 nautical miles east of Burlington's central business district, 17 nautical miles is significantly further than 3 nautical miles. My confidence is high (0.9) because the distances are explicitly provided in the context, though there's a small possibility I may have misread or misinterpreted the information.",Sawyer International Airport,False,True,,,Sawyer International Airport,claude-sonnet-4-20250514,halu_eval_qa

However, there's some confusion in the context - it appears to be mixing information about Sawyer International Airport with information about Burlington International Airport. The context states that Sawyer International Airport is located in South Burlington, which doesn't make geographical sense since Sawyer International Airport is in Michigan and South Burlington is in Vermont.

- Sawyer International Airport: 17 nautical miles from Marquette's central business district
- Burlington International Airport: 3 nautical miles from Burlington's central business district

However, the context does not specify that ""The Predator"" is set to be released on August 3, 2018. The context only describes it as ""upcoming"" without providing a specific release date.

However, the context then mentions that ""He received over 80 awards as an animation director and animator, and also developed the character of Goofy."" The pronoun ""He"" is ambiguous - it could refer to either animator mentioned, or potentially to someone else mentioned earlier in the context.

Given the grammatical structure and typical writing conventions, the pronoun ""He"" most likely refers to the last person specifically mentioned in their professional capacity, but the ambiguity makes it impossible to definitively determine from this context alone whether Art Babbitt received over 80 awards or if this refers to someone else.

The context states that since 1987, the US Open has been ""chronologically the fourth and final tennis major comprising the Grand Slam each year"" and that ""the other three, in chronological order, are the Australian Open, the French Open and Wimbledon.""

This means Wimbledon is the tennis major that comes immediately before the US Open in the yearly calendar. The context then mentions that the first tournament (referring to one of these majors) was ""first held in 1905.""

However, there's some ambiguity in the context about which tournament the ""1905"" date refers to. The sentence structure suggests it might be referring to the Australian Open (as the first mentioned), but historically, Wimbledon was first held in 1877, not 1905.

Given the context provided and the specific wording, the answer appears to be 1905, though I have some uncertainty due to the ambiguous phrasing in the source material.

Based on the context provided, Aldous Huxley had a broader scope of profession.

The context states that four expansion packs have been created, but it doesn't explicitly confirm that Keith Baker created the original game these expansions are for. While Keith Baker is identified as a game designer, there's no direct connection established between him and the game with these four expansion packs in the provided context. Therefore, while the answer ""Four"" is based on the information given, my confidence is low due to the ambiguous connection between Keith Baker and the game in question.",Four,False,True,,,Four,claude-sonnet-4-20250514,halu_eval_qa

The context indicates that Sansha administers several island groups including the Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, and other maritime features in the South China Sea, which would contain numerous individual islands. Xingning is described as a city in Guangdong with a land area of 2105 km², but there's no indication it contains islands - it appears to be a mainland city. Therefore, Sansha would contain significantly more islands than Xingning.
