Option C states that Southco owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. However, Southco initially owns only one class 2 building (Lynch Building). To acquire two more class 2 buildings, Southco would need to trade a class 1 building (Flores Tower) for two class 2 buildings.
