    ""Reasoning"": ""The estimate is based on the most recent life expectancy at birth for males in the United States, which, according to the CDC's 2022 data, is approximately 73.5 years. This figure represents the average age of death for a male born today. However, predicting the exact age of death for any single individual is highly uncertain due to wide variation in genetics, lifestyle, and random events. The confidence reflects this uncertainty; it is the statistical probability that a random American male will die within a 3-year window (+/- 1 year) centered on the average life expectancy, calculated using national life tables. This probability is inherently low because deaths are distributed across a wide range of ages, and very few individuals die at the exact average age."",

According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2021), an American male who has reached age 62 can expect to live, on average, another 20.3 years. This puts the average age at death at 62 + 20.3 = 82.3 years. This is a statistical average, and there is a wide distribution of actual outcomes. The confidence level is based on the probability that a male who is currently 62 will die within 10 years of our estimate of 82, meaning in the age range of 72 to 92. U.S. Social Security Administration life tables show that approximately 64% of 62-year-old men will die within this 20-year window.

This calculation leads to a mean age at death of approximately 85 (71 + 13.92 = 84.92). However, this is a statistical average, not a precise prediction for an individual. There is a wide distribution of actual ages at death around this average. The requested confidence is for the true age at death to be within 1 year of 85 (i.e., dying at age 84 or 85).

A person who has already reached age 82 has demonstrated above-average longevity, and their remaining life expectancy is calculated based on the survival rates of their current age cohort. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration's 2020 period life tables, a female who is 82 years old has an average of 8.24 years of life remaining. This leads to an estimated age at death of 82 + 8.24 = 90.24, which we round to 90. To calculate the confidence that the true age of death is within 10 years of our estimate (i.e., between 80 and 100), we look at the probability that an 82-year-old will die before her 100th birthday. Using the same life tables, we can see that out of the cohort of females who reach 82, approximately 90.5% will pass away before reaching age 100. This high probability reflects that while the average is around 90, the vast majority of deaths for this group occur within this 18-year window.",90,0.905,90.34,gemini-2.5-pro,life_eval

A person who has already reached age 99 has outlived the vast majority of her peers and has a different life expectancy than a person at birth. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration's 2020 actuarial life table, a 99-year-old female has an average remaining life expectancy of approximately 2.32 years. Adding this to her current age gives an estimated age at death of 101.32. The most reasonable integer guess is therefore 101. Our confidence is based on the statistical probability of death derived from these same tables. The probability of death for a 99-year-old is very high each year, so the outcomes are spread across several years. The calculated probability that a 99-year-old will die at age 100, 101, or 102 is approximately 52%. This reflects that while 101 is the average, a specific prediction within a narrow window is inherently uncertain.",101,0.52,101.3,gemini-2.5-pro,life_eval
