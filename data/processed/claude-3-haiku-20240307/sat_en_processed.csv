""Reasoning"": The passage indicates that Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge because it provides a vantage point to observe the ""procession of the sons of educated men"" that she wants to analyze. The bridge allows her to survey the city, see the barges on the river, and observe the educated men going about their professional activities. This suggests that the bridge is chosen primarily for its ability to offer a good view of the procession, rather than for its symbolic or reflective qualities.

""Reasoning"": The central claim of Passage 2 is that space mining has positive potential, but its effects should be thoughtfully considered before it becomes a reality. The passage acknowledges the potential benefits of space mining, such as the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies, but also raises concerns about the environmental and regulatory implications. It suggests that while space mining may sidestep some environmental concerns, its consequences both on Earth and in space merit careful consideration. The passage argues that a broad agreement on the for-profit exploitation of space is needed to ensure the gains are secure, rather than avoiding regulation altogether. This suggests the central claim is that the positive potential of space mining should be balanced with a thoughtful consideration of its effects.

""Reasoning"": The passage states that in the early 1990s, textbooks asserted that nerve fibers only responded to pain and temperature stimuli, and that sensations of pressure and vibration were believed to travel only along fast-signaling nerve fibers.

""Reasoning"": The passage clearly states that Olausson's 1993 experiment showed that gentle stroking of the skin prompted two different nerve signals - one immediate and one delayed.

""Reasoning"": The passage indicates that the 1999 experiment by Olausson's group aimed to determine the specific characteristics and functions of the CT fibers, which were newly discovered to respond to gentle touch in humans. The passage states that the researchers wanted to know if the CT fibers could distinguish the location and type of touch, and whether they could convey a pleasant sensation. This suggests that the primary goal was to understand the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey, rather than their relationship to body hair, their role in pain perception, or the effect of the microneurography technique.

""Reasoning"": The passage indicates that CT (C-tactile) fibers, which are slow-conducting unmyelinated nerves, are responsible for conveying the emotional aspect of touch. When G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate these CT fibers, only the insular cortex (which processes emotion) was active, suggesting that CT fibers specifically provide pleasurable sensations rather than the conscious aspects of touch. Therefore, the best answer is that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus.

""Reasoning"": The passage suggests that Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories as naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans. Passage 2 emphasizes that the Filipinos would ""protest against such a policy and resist to the extent of their ability"", indicating that they would not welcome foreign domination. This aligns with the view that Beveridge's vision is overly optimistic about the islanders' willingness to accept American rule.

""Reasoning"": The passage clearly states that exposure to light stimulates the germination of weed seeds that are buried in the soil. The key evidence is that in the experiment conducted by Sauer and Struik, weed growth was greater in the soil samples that were stirred up in the light compared to those stirred up in the dark. This indicates that light exposure is the critical factor that allows the seeds to germinate, rather than other factors like nutrient absorption or temperature tolerance.

""Reasoning"": The passage states that Hartmann's experiment involved two agricultural strips, one plowed during the day and the other at night, with no crops planted to avoid competition with the emerging weeds. The question asks what would likely have happened if crops were planted. Since the passage indicates that plowing at night reduces weed germination, it is reasonable to conclude that if crops were planted, the percentage of the surface covered by weeds would be lower than what Hartmann found in the uncropped experiment. This is the most logical inference based on the information provided.

The passage focuses on her interactions with Mrs. Quabarl, the woman who hired her, and does not indicate that Lady Carlotta is weighing the pros and cons of accepting the job or seeking revenge on an acquaintance.

""Reasoning"": The passage states that Bottke and his colleagues proposed that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets. This is because objects would have been more tightly packed nearer the Sun, leading to more frequent collisions that disrupted many differentiated bodies. Some of these fragments were then scattered into the asteroid belt by gravitational perturbations from larger bodies. This explanation aligns best with option B.

""Reasoning"": The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"" - the rarity of mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids in the meteorite collection and the asteroid belt. It suggests that the rocky mantle material is more easily destroyed than the iron core, leading to the survival of iron meteorites over rocky fragments. The passage also mentions that primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are more common than differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt today. Therefore, the data in the passage best supports the conclusion that the majority of the mass in the asteroid belt is in primitive asteroids.

138,"Passage: The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"" - the rarity of mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids in the meteorite collection and the asteroid belt. It explores several reasons why iron fragments may survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.

Question: Assuming that the four largest asteroid belt objects are among the 11 listed asteroid types, which statement about those asteroids is best supported by data in the table?

Options:
A) None of them is type V.
B) None of them is likely to contain carbon.
C) One of them is type K.
D) Two of them are the same type.

Reasoning: The passage does not provide any information about the specific types of the four largest asteroid belt objects. It only discusses the general rarity of mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids. Without any data on the types of the largest asteroids, the best we can say is that the passage does not provide enough information to confidently support any of the given statements. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the passage does not allow us to determine which of the statements is best supported.

202,"Reasoning: The passages present contrasting views on the issue of abolitionism. Lincoln argues for strictly obeying the law, even if it means tolerating unjust laws, while Thoreau advocates for civil disobedience and directly withdrawing support from the government to advance the abolitionist cause. Based on this, the best answer is that both authors see the abolitionist cause as central to their argument, even though they differ in their proposed approaches.

Answer: B

A: 0.2 - While Thoreau advocates for drastic action, Lincoln's stance is more moderate.
B: 0.7 - Both authors clearly see the abolitionist cause as a key part of their broader arguments.
C: 0.1 - The passages suggest the authors have different expectations about the cause's acceptance.
D: 0.0 - The passages indicate both authors are deeply invested in the abolitionist cause.",,False,False,,,,,,,D,claude-3-haiku-20240307,sat_en

""Reasoning"": The passage clearly states that two-sided solar panels can absorb light from both the front and back, which can increase their power output by 10-20% compared to one-sided panels. This is because the light that falls on the land between rows of solar panels can be reflected onto the back of the panels and harvested. The passage does not mention anything about the energy requirements, manufacturing costs, or preventing light from reaching the ground as factors for the increased efficiency of two-sided panels.
