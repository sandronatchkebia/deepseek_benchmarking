The context provided indicates that Paul ""Bear"" Bryant coached at the University of Alabama from 1958 to 1982, winning six national championships with the program.

Since the question asks which team Guerrero played for in 1985 other than the Dodgers, and the context does not indicate he played for any other team that year, the most likely answer is that he did not play in the major leagues in 1985.
