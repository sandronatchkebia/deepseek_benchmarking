The average American male life expectancy at birth is around 76 years, but someone who has already reached 99 has outlived most of their cohort and demonstrated exceptional longevity. At this advanced age, mortality rates increase significantly each year. Based on actuarial data, males who reach 99 typically have a life expectancy of about 2-3 more years, putting their total expected lifespan around 101-102 years. However, there is significant individual variation based on health status, genetics, and other factors not specified. Some centenarians live well past 105, while others may not reach 100. Given the question asks about confidence within a 20-year range (roughly 89-129), I can be quite confident since this range is extremely wide for someone already 99 years old.",102,0.95,101.0,claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219,life_eval
