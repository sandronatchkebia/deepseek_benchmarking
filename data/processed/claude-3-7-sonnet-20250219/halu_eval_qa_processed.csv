The context mentions:
1. Celebrities that endorsed the diet include Demi Moore and Madonna
2. ""Her first film to become both a critical and commercial hit was 'About Last Night...' (1986), which established her as a Hollywood star.""

The ""her"" in the second sentence refers to one of the previously mentioned celebrities. Since the question asks about an actress who starred in ""About Last Night..."" and endorsed the Werewolf Diet, I need to determine which of the two mentioned celebrities (Demi Moore or Madonna) starred in that film.

Based on my knowledge, Demi Moore did star in ""About Last Night..."" (1986), which matches the context. Madonna did not star in this film.

Looking at these facts together and researching film history, Demi Moore starred in ""About Last Night..."" (1986). Since she's both mentioned as endorsing the diet and starred in the film, she is the answer.

The context mentions a mixtape that features appearances by several artists, including Yo Gotti. It also states that Yo Gotti (whose real name is Mario Mims) debuted in 1996 with the album ""Youngsta's On a Come Up"" under the alias Lil Yo.

The question asks about a mixtape called ""Only God Can Judge Me"" and which rapper who debuted in 1996 appeared on it. Based on the context, Yo Gotti debuted in 1996, and he is mentioned as appearing on a mixtape (though the mixtape name in the context is not specified).

There's a mismatch between the mixtape name in the question (""Only God Can Judge Me"") and the unnamed mixtape in the context.

He is also the Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering.""

The question asks about who was the Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering who helped design the A113 Easter Egg. There are two issues with the question:

1. The context doesn't state that any of these individuals ""designed"" the Easter egg - it says A113 refers to a classroom used by these alumni.
2. The ""He is also"" in the context is ambiguous about which person it refers to.

Based on the structure of the sentence, ""He"" most likely refers to the last person mentioned (Brad Bird), but this isn't entirely clear from the context.

The question asks about a two-leg match played on August 20 and 23, 1997, which would be after the 1996-97 La Liga season ended (June 23, 1997).

The context mentions a person who painted portraits, including one of ""General William Westmoreland."" It also states that ""He served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1968 to 1972.""

There's an ambiguity here about who ""He"" refers to - the painter or General Westmoreland. Based on historical knowledge, General William Westmoreland did serve as Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army from 1968 to 1972. This means the painter (who appears to be Herbert Abrams based on the question) painted a portrait of Westmoreland, who was the Chief of Staff.

The context mentions that someone ""painted more than 400 portraits"" including one of ""General William Westmoreland."" It also states that Westmoreland ""served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1968 to 1972.""

The question asks what sort of art Herbert Abrams completed using the Chief of Staff (Westmoreland) as a subject. Based on the context, Herbert Abrams must be the artist who painted portraits, and one of his subjects was General Westmoreland.

The context specifically mentions ""portraits"" and not landscapes, so the answer provided is incorrect.

The context mentions that the Merrill Shell Bank Light was south of Pass Christian, Mississippi, and that ""The population was 4,613 at the 2010 census."" However, it's not explicitly clear whether this population figure refers to Pass Christian or some other location.

Looking at the structure of the context, the population figure appears immediately after mentioning Pass Christian, which suggests it's referring to Pass Christian's population. However, the question asks about a town ""south of"" the Merrill Shell Bank Light, while the context states that Pass Christian is north of the lighthouse (since the lighthouse is ""south of Pass Christian"").

This creates a discrepancy - the context doesn't actually mention any town south of the lighthouse.

The context mentions that the lighthouse was south of Pass Christian, Mississippi. The population figure of 4,613 at the 2010 census appears to refer to Pass Christian, not to a town south of the lighthouse. In fact, the lighthouse is south of the town.

There's a discrepancy here. The context doesn't mention Eric Zaslow at all. The SYZ conjecture is typically attributed to Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow (hence ""SYZ""), but the context only mentions two of these three people explicitly.

The context states that FC Bayern Munich won the domestic double, beating Werder Bremen in Bundesliga and defeating Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal final thanks to a goal from Claudio Pizarro.

The context also provides information about Claudio Pizarro's full name: ""Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio"".

However, there are several issues with the question:

1. The question asks about ""the man who won the football match against Werder Bremen in 2005-06"" - but it was a team (FC Bayern Munich) that won, not an individual.

2. The question asks for ""two middle names"" but Pizarro only has one middle name (Miguel) and one surname (Pizarro, with Bosio being his second surname as is common in Spanish naming customs).

3. The context doesn't specifically state that the matches occurred in 2005-06.

Given these issues, I cannot provide a fully accurate answer to the question as phrased.

The context doesn't provide specific information about the number of American film credits for either director.

- It was produced by Walt Disney and directed by Wilfred Jackson
- It was animated by Art Babbitt and Les Clark
- Someone ""received over 80 awards as an animation director and animator""
- Someone ""developed the character of Goofy""

The question asks about the alphabetically first animator of The Country Cousin. Between Art Babbitt and Les Clark, Art Babbitt comes first alphabetically.

The context mentions someone receiving over 80 awards, but it doesn't explicitly state this was Art Babbitt. The sentence structure makes it unclear who ""He"" refers to in ""He received over 80 awards..."" - it could be referring to Walt Disney, Wilfred Jackson, or one of the animators.

Given this ambiguity, I cannot confidently attribute the 80+ awards to Art Babbitt specifically.

The context mentions several drag racers: Richard Petty, Shirley Muldowney, Don Prudhomme, and Bunny Burkett. It then states ""She was the first woman to receive a license from the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) to drive a Top Fuel dragster.""

The ""she"" in this sentence must refer to one of the women mentioned earlier - either Shirley Muldowney or Bunny Burkett. Based on historical facts (though not explicitly stated in the context), Shirley Muldowney was indeed the first woman to receive an NHRA license for Top Fuel dragsters.

However, the question asks about ""the first woman to receive a license from the NHRA AND also to race at a Speedway that was home to the President's Cup Nationals."" The context doesn't explicitly state which speedway hosted the President's Cup Nationals or which of these women raced there first.

Given the limited information in the context, I cannot definitively determine the answer.
