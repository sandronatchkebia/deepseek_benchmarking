    ""Reasoning"": ""The average life expectancy for a 16-year-old American male is approximately 77 years, based on conditional life expectancy from U.S. mortality data (e.g., Social Security Administration period life tables). This accounts for survival past childhood risks. However, lifespan variability is high—standard deviation is roughly 15 years—due to factors like genetics, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status. The interval [72, 82] (77 ± 5 years) covers only a portion of this distribution. Using cohort survival data, about 29% of 16-year-old males die between ages 72–82. Confidence is moderate because the interval is narrow relative to the uncertainty."",

    ""Reasoning"": ""The life expectancy for an American male at birth is approximately 76-77 years. However, since the individual has already survived to age 23, this eliminates early-life mortality risks.

Population data shows substantial variability in lifespans, with a standard deviation of around 15 years for adult mortality. The interval [68, 88] (i.e., 78 ± 10) covers approximately 68% of expected outcomes based on life-table distributions, reflecting typical dispersion.

    ""Reasoning"": ""The life expectancy at age 97 for U.S. males is approximately 2.5 years, leading to an expected death age of 99.5. Rounding to the nearest integer gives 100. However, the distribution of death ages is wide: based on the 2019 U.S. period life table, the probability of dying at age 97 is 31.8%, at 98 is 23.5%, at 99 is 16.9%, at 100 is 11.5%, and at 101 is 7.4%. The probability that the true death age is within 1 year of 100 (i.e., 99, 100, or 101) is the sum of these probabilities for ages 99–101, calculated as 0.169 + 0.115 + 0.074 = 0.358.

    ""Reasoning"": ""The average life expectancy for a U.S. female is approximately 81 years. Since she has already survived to age 9 (avoiding infant/child mortality risks), actuarial data suggests her remaining life expectancy increases slightly. Using general population statistics, a female surviving past age 5 typically lives to ~82 years. However, individual outcomes vary widely due to genetics, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors.
