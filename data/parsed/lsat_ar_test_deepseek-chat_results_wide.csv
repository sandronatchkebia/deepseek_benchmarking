Frost must be with Heideck, which is satisfied. However, if Gonzalez is at Thorne, Lai must be at Silva (per the third constraint), but Lai is not assigned here, which is acceptable since the constraint is conditional on Gonzalez being at Silva. The issue is with the fourth constraint: if Knutson is not at Thorne (he isn't in Option A), then Heideck and Mays must be at Thorne. Heideck is present, but Mays is also present, which seems to satisfy the constraint. However, the first constraint requires Frost to be with Heideck, which is satisfied. But the second constraint states that if Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be at different ceremonies. In Option A, Lai is not assigned, so this doesn't apply. Thus, Option A does not violate any constraints. Re-evaluating, Option D includes Gonzalez, Knutson, and Mays at Thorne. If Knutson is at Thorne, the fourth constraint does not apply. However, if Gonzalez is at Thorne, Lai must be at Silva (third constraint), which is not violated here. But the second constraint requires Lai and Mays to be at different ceremonies if both are assigned. Since Lai is not assigned here, this is fine. However, the first constraint requires Frost to be with Heideck, but neither is assigned to Thorne in Option D, which is acceptable since not all photographers need to be assigned. But the question asks for the assignment that CANNOT be correct. Option E includes only Knutson and Mays at Thorne. If Knutson is at Thorne, the fourth constraint does not apply. However, Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony, but neither is assigned here, which is acceptable since not all need to be assigned. But the second constraint requires Lai and Mays to be at different ceremonies if both are assigned. Since Lai is not assigned here, this is fine. However, the first constraint requires Frost and Heideck to be together at one ceremony, but they are not assigned here, which is acceptable.
