    ""Reasoning"": ""The question is asking whether the energy required to produce ethanol is greater than the energy it produces when used as fuel. Ethanol is typically produced from crops like corn, and the energy balance includes the energy used in farming, transportation, and processing. Studies have shown that corn-based ethanol has a positive energy balance, meaning it produces more energy than is consumed in its production, though the exact ratio can vary based on methods and assumptions. However, the margin is not always large, and some studies argue it can be close to neutral or even negative under certain conditions. Given the general consensus, the answer is likely 'False,' but with some uncertainty due to variability in production methods."",

A 'double' refers to a domino tile with the same number on both ends (e.g., 5-5). In Chicken Foot, doubles are typically played sideways, creating four open ends (one on each side of the double) for future plays. However, the rules can vary slightly depending on house rules or regional variations. Generally, you can play a double in Chicken Foot, but it must be placed sideways to open up additional playable ends.
