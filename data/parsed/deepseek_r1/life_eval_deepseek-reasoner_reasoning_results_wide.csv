}",103.0,True,False,"The person is an American female who has already lived to 100. Based on U.S. life tables for centenarians, the average remaining life expectancy at age 100 is approximately 2.3 years, leading to an expected age at death of 102.3. Rounded to the nearest integer, this is 102. However, females generally have slightly higher longevity than males, and recent data suggests female centenarians have a remaining life expectancy closer to 2.5 years, supporting an estimate of 103.

    ""Reasoning"": ""A 100-year-old American female has already surpassed typical life expectancy. According to U.S. life tables (e.g., Social Security Administration data), the remaining life expectancy at age 100 is approximately 2.4 years, suggesting an average death age of 102.4. I rounded to 102 for an integer estimate. The true age at death must be ≥100, and the maximum verified human age is 122. The interval [102 - 20, 102 + 20] = [82, 122] covers all plausible values (100–122), as 100 is well above 82 and 122 is the upper bound. No verified person has exceeded 122, making an age >122 statistically negligible. Thus, I am certain the true value lies within this range."",
