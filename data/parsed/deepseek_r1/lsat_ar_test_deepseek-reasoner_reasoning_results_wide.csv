Option C satisfies all conditions: George reports on Tuesday (only day allowed); Robert reports in the morning (not afternoon); Olivia is absent, which is acceptable since only six report; Nina is absent, so no conditional trigger. Other options violate: A has Robert in afternoon; B has Olivia in afternoon; D has Nina on Monday but Helen not on Tuesday; E has George on Wednesday. Confidence is high as violations are clear.

58,"### Reasoning:
The original constraint ""If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne is assigned"" (J → K) must be substituted with an equivalent constraint. Given the existing constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke is assigned but not both (K XOR N), J → K is logically equivalent to ""Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned"" (¬(J ∧ N)), which is option D. This equivalence holds because if J is assigned, K must be assigned (implying N is not), and if J and N cannot both be assigned, it forces K to be assigned when J is assigned. Other options do not enforce the same relationship between J and K and could allow assignments violating the original constraint. Confidence is high due to the logical equivalence under the given constraints.

Given that the violinist (V) performs the fourth solo, the keyboard player (K) must be fifth and the guitarist (G) sixth due to the constraints (V before K and K before G, with G not fourth). Positions 1–3 are filled by the percussionist (P), saxophonist (S), and trumpeter (T). S must be in position 2 to satisfy ""S after exactly one of P or T but not both"" (if S is first, it can't be after anyone; if last, it would be after both). Thus, the orders for positions 1–3 are either P,S,T or T,S,P.  

- **A, B, C, D must be true**: P is always before V (position 1 or 3 vs. 4), T before V (1 or 3 vs. 4), T before G (1 or 3 vs. 6), S before V (2 vs. 4).  
- **E is not always true**: T before S only occurs in the T,S,P order (position 1 before 2), but not in P,S,T (position 3 after 2). Thus, E is not necessarily true and is the exception. Confidence is high (near 1.0) as the deduction is strict from constraints.

Given watercolors is third, lithographs must be fourth (since both oil and watercolors must precede it). Oil must be second (as Farley must precede oil, and oil cannot be first).

Given Taylor is not a project member, Smith cannot be a member (from constraint: if Smith is a member, Taylor must be). This leaves Quinn (Q), Ruiz (R), Verma (V), Wells (W), and Xue (X) as possible members, with exactly three to be selected. Constraints: Q or R can only be members if leader; if W is a member, neither R nor V can be. Possible teams:
- If W is selected: team must be Q, W, X (since R and V excluded, and Q must be leader).
- If W is not selected: teams are Q, V, X (Q leader) or R, V, X (R leader); Q and R cannot both be members due to leader conflict.

In all cases (Q,W,X; Q,V,X; R,V,X), Xue is always a member. No other worker is present in every possible team. Thus, Xue must be a member. Confidence is high as the constraints eliminate other possibilities.
