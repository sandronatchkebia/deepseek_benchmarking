2,"### Reasoning:
If Helen and Nina report on the same day, it cannot be Monday or Tuesday. On Monday, Nina would require Helen and Irving on Tuesday, but Helen cannot report twice. On Tuesday, Nina would require them on Wednesday, conflicting with Helen already reporting. This forces the day to be Wednesday, where Nina's condition doesn't apply. Other pairs lack such constraints and can be scheduled on other days without issues. Confidence is high due to clear logical conflict.

{

3,"### Reasoning:
George must report on Tuesday. Nina cannot be on Monday, as it would require Helen and Irving on Tuesday, conflicting with George and the two-report limit. Nina and Robert must be on different days from George and each other, so Nina is on Wednesday and Robert is on Monday. Olivia cannot report on Monday as Robert occupies the morning slot, and she must report in the morning. Robert cannot be on Wednesday, as it forces Nina to Monday, which is invalid. Thus, Helen on Wednesday (option A) is possible, while other options are impossible.

4,"### Reasoning:
George must give a report on Tuesday morning because Kyle is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon and George can only report on Tuesday. This eliminates options A, C, and E, as they list someone other than George for Tuesday morning. Between options B and D, both list George for Tuesday morning. However, option B (Lenore on Monday, George on Tuesday, Irving on Wednesday) leads to a contradiction: with Helen on Wednesday afternoon, the only open slot is Monday afternoon, but Nina cannot report (due to her constraint conflicting with the fixed Tuesday reports), and Olivia/Robert cannot take afternoon slots, leaving no valid reporter. Option D (Robert on Monday, George on Tuesday, Irving on Wednesday) works: Robert (who must report in the morning) is on Monday morning, Irving on Wednesday morning, and Lenore can take Monday afternoon with Nina and Olivia not reporting, satisfying all constraints. I am highly confident in this reasoning.

Himalayans must be on days 2, 4, and 6 to satisfy the constraints (exactly three non-consecutive days, not day 1 or 7). Puppy on day 2 must be Newfoundland (cannot be Greyhound due to day 1, and Rottweiler is excluded on Himalayan days). Puppy on day 6 must be Greyhound (cannot be Newfoundland due to day 7, and Rottweiler is excluded). Thus, day 2 and day 6 have different puppy breeds (Newfoundland vs. Greyhound), making it impossible for them to have the same puppy breed, let alone both same kitten and puppy breeds. For other pairs, assignments exist where both breeds match (e.g., day 1 and 3 can both have Greyhound and Manx). Confidence is high due to fixed Himalayan days and puppy constraints.

The condition that one kind's first batch is on the same day as another kind's third batch must hold. Given the constraints (e.g., S2 on Thursday, S3 on Friday, O2 and P1 on the same day), the only feasible day for O2 and P1 is Tuesday, forcing O1 to Monday and S1 to Wednesday. The pairing condition (e.g., S1 and O3 or S1 and P3 on Wednesday) ensures Wednesday has at least two batches. Monday always has exactly one batch (O1), Tuesday exactly two (O2 and P1), and Thursday at least one (S2). Friday always has S3 but may have O3 or P3, so it can have one or two batches.

Jiang must review exactly one play because if Jiang reviewed two or three plays, Lopez and Megregian would have no plays to review (due to the disjoint condition), contradicting that they each review at least one. Megregian reviews two plays, as established from the conditions: with Jiang reviewing one play, only two plays remain, and Megregian must review more than Lopez (who reviews one). Thus, Megregian always reviews more plays than Jiang. Options A, C, D, and E may not hold: A is false (both Jiang and Lopez review one play); C is false (O'Neill may review two plays, same as Megregian); D and E are false (O'Neill may review only one play, equal to Jiang or Kramer).

Options A and E omit one of them and are invalid. For option B (only Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane), Jiang must review a play, but due to disjointness with Lopez and Megregian (condition 2), and Megregian reviewing more plays than Kramer and Lopez (condition 1), conflicts arise, making it impossible. For option C (Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill review Tamerlane), Lopez reviewing Tamerlane prevents Jiang from reviewing it, but disjointness and the requirement for exactly two identical review sets (condition 4) lead to contradictions. Option D (Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill review Tamerlane) works: e.g., Jiang reviews only Sunset, Lopez reviews only Undulation, Megregian reviews Tamerlane and Undulation, Kramer and O'Neill review only Tamerlane (identical sets), satisfying all conditions.

Given that Jiang does not review Tamerlane, and considering the constraints:
- Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, so Megregian must review exactly 2 plays (since reviewing 1 or 3 leads to contradictions with the conditions).
- Kramer reviews only Tamerlane (as he must review fewer than Megregian and reviews Tamerlane).
- Jiang reviews one play (Sunset or Undulation) but not both, as reviewing both would conflict with Lopez and Megregian not reviewing any play Jiang reviews.
- Lopez reviews one play, disjoint from Jiang's play.
- Since Jiang does not review Tamerlane, and Lopez/Megregian cannot review Jiang's plays, Megregian must review Tamerlane and the other play not reviewed by Jiang (e.g., if Jiang reviews Sunset, Megregian reviews Tamerlane and Undulation; if Jiang reviews Undulation, Megregian reviews Sunset and Tamerlane).
- The identical sets condition is satisfied in all valid scenarios without affecting this outcome.

The condition that Togowa has a higher-numbered space than Souza (T > S) combines with the rules: Robertson > Young > Togowa (R > Y > T), Xu > Souza (X > S), and Robertson in {1,2,3,4}. Since spaces are integers 1-6 and R > Y > T, R cannot be 1 or 2 (as it would force Y or T below 1). R must be 4 (only possible value), forcing Y=3 (since Y < R and Y > T), T=2 (since T < Y and T > S, with S < T), and S=1 (only lower space). Spaces 5 and 6 are for Xu and Vaughn.

The constraints force specific limitations on parking spaces:
- Togowa must be in space 1 or 2 (due to T < Y and Y ≥ 2).
- Young must be in space 2 or 3 (Y < R and R ≤ 4).
- Robertson must be in space 3 or 4 (R cannot be 1 or 2, and R ≤ 4).
- Xu must be in space 5 or 6 (X must be higher than S, and the only available higher spaces are 5 and 6 in all cases).
Souza can be in space 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (depending on assignments), and Vaughn can be in any space (1-6), so neither is limited to two spaces. Thus, four employees (Togowa, Young, Robertson, Xu) have exactly two possible spaces. Confidence is high due to clear constraints.

With Robertson fixed at space #3, Robertson must be higher than Young (rule 3), so Young must be #1 or #2. However, Young must be higher than Togowa (rule 1), meaning Togowa needs a lower space.

Option A states that I and M are on the same shelf. Since I is fixed on the middle shelf, M must also be on the middle shelf. Given that F is on the same shelf as M, F is also on the middle shelf. Thus, the middle shelf has at least I, F, and M (three books). This forces the distribution to be (2,3,3) for (top, middle, bottom), as (2,2,4) would only allow two books on the middle shelf. K must be higher than F (on middle), so K is on the top shelf. O must be higher than L, and L cannot be on top (as no higher shelf), so L must be on the bottom shelf, and O on the top shelf to satisfy O > L. Top shelf then has K and O. The remaining books (G, H, L) are on the bottom shelf, fully determining all shelves. Other options do not force a unique arrangement, as they allow multiple valid distributions or shelf assignments.

In all valid distributions (shelf counts (2,3,3) or (2,2,4)), O ends up on a higher shelf than M: when F (and M) are on the bottom, O is not on the bottom (as O must be higher than L), so O is on middle or top; when F (and M) are on the middle, O is forced to the top shelf due to space constraints and the condition that O is higher than L.

Given that Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, the constraints force Lan to always be in an afternoon session. Specifically:

- Nessa must be in a PM slot.
- Olivia must be after Julio and is always in an AM slot in valid assignments.
- Lan must avoid Olivia's day, leaving Lan with only PM slots available across all valid assignments.

Thus, option A (Lan on Wednesday morning) cannot occur, as all AM slots are filled by Julio, Kevin, and Olivia. Options B, C, D, and E are possible in different valid assignments.

Options B–E violate conditions: B forces |Zone 2| ≤ 1 but requires Udall in Zone 2, contradicting Stuckey/Udall together; C requires Tiao in Zone 1 and Udall in Zone 2, but Stuckey must join Udall, making |Zone 2| ≥ 2 vs. |Zone 3| = 2; D has neither Tiao nor Udall in Zone 2, violating ""either/or""; E forces Tiao into both Zone 1 and Zone 2.

Given that the fifth solo is traditional, the constraints force specific assignments: Solo 1 must be modern (to satisfy ""no traditional until Wayne plays modern""), played by Wayne (since it precedes the first traditional at solo 2). Solo 4 must be modern (to avoid multiple consecutive traditional pairs), played by Zara (to satisfy the fourth solo condition). Solo 2 must be traditional to form the required consecutive pair with solo 3. However, pianists for solos 2, 3, and 5 can vary: solo 2 and solo 5 must differ (constraint 4), and solo 3 has no restrictions. Thus, only solos 1 and 4 have fixed performers. Confidence is high as all constraints are satisfied with no alternatives.

Given that solo 5 is Wayne performing a traditional piece, the conditions force solo 2 to be Zara (due to the pianist conflict), solo 1 to be Wayne modern (to satisfy ""no traditional until Wayne's modern piece""), and the consecutive traditional pair must include solo 3, leading to solos 2 and 3 being traditional (as (3,4) is impossible with solo 5 traditional). Thus, solo 4 must be modern and performed by Zara (from condition 3). Solo 3 can be performed by either pianist, making option C possible.

Given that romance begins before western and western before horror, romance must start at 7 PM on screen 1 (since it cannot be on screen 2), western at 8 PM on screen 3, and horror at 9 PM. The remaining movies (mystery and sci-fi) must fill the 7 PM slot on screen 2 and the 9 PM slot on either screen 1 or 2, depending on horror's screen. However, horror and mystery must be on different screens, leading to two cases:  
- If horror is on screen 1 at 9 PM, sci-fi and mystery are both on screen 2 (at 7 PM and 9 PM).  
- If horror is on screen 2 at 9 PM, mystery is on screen 1 at 9 PM and sci-fi is on screen 2 at 7 PM.  
In both cases, sci-fi is always on screen 2. Therefore, option E must be true. Other options are not necessarily true based on the cases. Confidence is high due to the constraints forcing sci-fi to screen 2.

The guitarist cannot perform the third solo because it would violate the constraints. If the guitarist is third, the keyboard player must be before the guitarist (positions 1 or 2). Keyboard at position 1 is impossible because the violinist must perform before the keyboard player, leaving no position for the violinist. Thus, keyboard must be at position 2, requiring violinist at position 1. However, the percussionist must perform before the keyboard player (position 2), forcing percussionist to position 1, which conflicts with violinist at position 1. This contradiction makes it impossible for the guitarist to be third. Other options (keyboard, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist) can be third under specific valid orderings, but trumpeter also cannot be third due to saxophonist constraints, though guitarist is the primary focus here.

151,"The question asks which pair of colors cannot be the two solid rugs when there are exactly two solids. The constraints are: white must be in a multicolored rug with two other colors; olive must be with peach in the same rug; and forest-turquoise, peach-turquoise, and peach-yellow cannot be together in a rug. With two solid rugs, the third rug is multicolored using three of the remaining colors, with one color unused.

For option D (peach and yellow solids):
- Peach solid means olive cannot be used (as olive requires peach in the same rug).
- Yellow solid means it is not with peach, which is acceptable since they are in different rugs.
- The multicolored rug must use the remaining three colors: forest, turquoise, and white (since olive is unused).
- However, forest and turquoise cannot be in the same rug, violating a constraint.
- No alternative multicolored combination is possible, as olive cannot be used and other choices force forest and turquoise together or violate usage rules.

Other options are possible:
- A (forest and peach solids): Multicolored with turquoise, white, yellow; no conflicts.
- B (forest and yellow solids): Multicolored with olive, peach, white; no conflicts.
- C (peach and turquoise solids): Multicolored with forest, white, yellow; no conflicts.
- E (turquoise and yellow solids): Multicolored with olive, peach, white (or forest); no conflicts.

Thus, only D leads to a contradiction. Confidence is high as the reasoning is direct from constraints.

226,"### Reasoning
The scenario involves trading buildings under specific rules, with a fixed total of 2 class 1, 4 class 2, and 2 class 3 buildings. For a company to own two class 1 buildings (e.g., Flores Tower and Garza Tower), it must acquire one without losing its own. However, acquiring a class 1 building requires trading either another class 1 (resulting in no net gain) or two class 2 buildings. RealProp starts with no class 2 buildings and cannot accumulate two class 2 without losing its class 1 building (e.g., by trading it away). Even with trades, no sequence allows RealProp to hold both class 1 buildings simultaneously, as this would violate trade constraints or building conservation. Options B, C, D, and E are possible through valid trades (e.g., same-class swaps or multi-building exchanges), so only A cannot be true. Confidence is high due to exhaustive trade analysis.

227,"### Reasoning:
RealProp starts with one class 1 and two class 3 buildings and must end with only class 2 buildings. To achieve this, RealProp must trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. Only Trustcorp has sufficient class 2 buildings (initially three) to provide two for this trade. After this trade, Trustcorp acquires the class 1 building and retains it, as trading it away (e.g., for two class 2) is not feasible without disrupting RealProp's goal of holding only class 2. Thus, Trustcorp always ends with a class 1 building, making option A true in all cases. Other options are not necessarily true, as they depend on specific trade sequences (e.g., Southco may not own class 2 or class 3 buildings if involved in trades).

228,"**Reasoning:**  
Trustcorp starts with three class 2 buildings and must lose all class 2 through trades. The only ways to reduce class 2 involve gaining class 3 or class 1 buildings. Class 3 buildings are initially only owned by RealProp (Yates and Zimmer). For Trustcorp to end with no class 2, it must acquire both class 3 buildings from RealProp in a ""class 2 for two class 3"" trade, as these are the only class 3 buildings available. Thus, Trustcorp must own Zimmer House (class 3) after trades. Options A-D are not always true, as scenarios exist where RealProp lacks class 1, Southco owns class 1, no trade with Southco occurs, or Trustcorp owns Flores instead of Garza. Confidence is high since Zimmer House ownership is inevitable in all valid sequences.
