**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states ""He was also a United States Navy combat veteran of World War II"" immediately following the list of actors. Jason Robards (1922–2000) is historically documented as a decorated WWII Navy veteran who served in the Pacific Theater, aligning with the context. Other actors (e.g., Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman) were born post-WWII or lack military records matching this service.

**Explanation:**

1. Bayern signed Dante among others  
2. Dante's birthdate is ""18 October 1983""

Explanation:  
The context explicitly states: ""It [Bengali] is the national and official language of the People's Republic of Bangladesh."" This is a direct, unambiguous statement requiring no interpretation. The mention of Indian states where Bengali is official does not contradict Bangladesh's status as the nation where Bengali holds both national and official designation.

- No other signed players have birthdates mentioned, eliminating ambiguity.  
- Confidence is 0.99 (near-certain) since the answer is directly supported by the text. The minimal uncertainty accounts for potential context gaps about other players' birthdates.",Dante Bonfim Costa Santos,False,True,,Dante Bonfim Costa Santos,0.99

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states Alexander Thynn (author of ""The Carry-Cot,"" which inspired the film *Blue Blood*) had an estimated wealth of **£157 million** in the 2009 Sunday Times Rich List. The term ""wealth intensifying"" appears to be a misinterpretation or typo; the context only provides the author's wealth, not the novel's financial impact. Confidence is high (0.95) because the figure is directly stated, with minor uncertainty due to the ambiguous phrasing of the question.",£157 million,False,True,,£157 million,0.95

**Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states that *¡Viva Zapata!* is a tribute album to Mia Zapata, confirming it includes content about her.  
- Confidence is 0.9 (not 1.0) because while the album title and purpose directly reference her, the context doesn't name a *specific song* within the album.

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states that ""Stomp the Yard"" (the 2007 film using ""Let's Go"") was released on **January 12, 2007**. The confidence is 0.95 (95%) because:  
1. The context directly provides the release date.  
2. No conflicting dates are mentioned.  
The slight uncertainty (5%) accounts for potential regional release variations or unmentioned edge cases, though the context gives a clear primary date.","January 12, 2007",False,True,,"January 12, 2007",0.95

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states that the album (7 Year Bitch's second release) is titled as a tribute to Mia Zapata, confirming it includes content about her. However, the context does not specify the album's name or mention a *specific song* about her, only the album's overarching tribute. This creates moderate uncertainty (0.7 confidence) as the question asks for an album with ""a song"" about Mia, while the context emphasizes the album-level dedication without song details.",The second album by 7 Year Bitch,False,True,,The second album by 7 Year Bitch,0.7

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states Paphiopedilum belongs to Orchidaceae, a family of flowering plants.  
- Soleirolia soleirolii (mentioned in context) is a recognized flowering plant species in the nettle family (Urticaceae), though the truncated context (""syn."") implies incomplete taxonomy.

Explanation:  
The context explicitly states that ""he won three consecutive gold medals"" at the Far Eastern Championship Games. While the name ""Jan Tauren"" doesn't appear in the context, the question directly links the achievement to him. This creates slight ambiguity about whether ""he"" refers to Tauren, reducing confidence to 0.8. However, given the specificity of the event (decathlon at the Far Eastern Games) and the question's phrasing, ""three"" is the only medal count mentioned.",three,False,True,,three,0.8

**Explanation:**

However, the name ""Jan Tauren"" does not appear in the provided context, creating uncertainty about whether the referenced athlete is Jan Tauren.

**Reasoning:**  
The context explicitly states Harrison Chad voiced Boots in ""Dora the Explorer"" (2000-2007). The show was created and executive produced by Chris Gifford and Valerie Walsh, matching the query. ""Go, Diego, Go!"" is mentioned as a spin-off but Chad's role is only attributed to ""Dora the Explorer"".

- It then notes that ""*her* first film... was 'About Last Night...' (1986)"" – the pronoun ""her"" refers to **Demi Moore** (confirmed by real-world knowledge that she starred in the film, while Madonna did not).

- While the context explicitly credits David Puttnam as producer of *You and I*, historical records confirm he also produced *The Killing Fields*.

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states SL Green Realty operates only in New York City, while General Motors operates in 35 countries.  
- GM's multinational presence (manufacturing, distribution, and financial services across 35 nations) is fundamentally broader than SL Green's single-city focus.

**Reasoning:**  
- **SL Green Realty** operates exclusively in New York City (focused on office buildings/shopping centers), per the context.  
- **General Motors** operates in 35 countries with diversified activities (manufacturing, distribution, financial services), indicating significantly broader geographic and operational scope.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) because the context explicitly states GM's multinational presence versus SL Green's localized focus.

- While Norway is mentioned regarding the namesake (Saint Olaf II), the affiliation confirms the institution's location in the U.S.

    ""Answer"": ""Gray is technically larger than Corbin in terms of incorporated area."",
    ""Confidence"": 0.7
}

**Explanation:**  
The context explains that Corbin's urbanized area extends beyond its city limits due to Kentucky's law prohibiting cities from spanning more than two counties. This means Corbin's *incorporated* area (official city size) is artificially limited, while Gray (mentioned in the question as a distinct community 4.9 miles west) likely has a larger incorporated territory by comparison. However, since the context doesn't provide explicit population/area data, this inference relies on legal constraints affecting Corbin's size, hence the moderate confidence.",Gray is technically larger than Corbin in terms of incorporated area.,False,True,,Gray is technically larger than Corbin in terms of incorporated area.,0.7

**Confidence Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states Jem Finer is the creator of Longplayer and confirms his full name (Jeremy Max Finer) and exact birthdate (25 July 1955).  
- Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) because while the context is unambiguous, there's a minimal chance of transcription errors in the provided text. The birthplace mentioned in the example response (""France"") is unsupported by the context and was intentionally omitted here.","Longplayer is a self-extending composition by Jeremy Max ""Jem"" Finer, who was born on July 25, 1955.",False,True,,"Longplayer is a self-extending composition by Jeremy Max ""Jem"" Finer, who was born on July 25, 1955.",0.95

} 

**Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states: *""She was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in 'Picket Fences'""*.  
- ""Picket Fences"" is a television series (1992–1996), not a movie, which directly addresses the query about her nomination.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) because the context is unambiguous, though deducted 0.05 due to the question's incorrect assumption of a ""movie"" nomination.","The actress Amy Aquino, who played Donna in ""Being Human"", was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in the TV series ""Picket Fences"" (not a movie).

This confirms Southridge Mall is tied for **largest**, not second largest. Confidence is 0.95 (high) because:  
1. The phrasing ""tied with... largest mall"" is unambiguous.  
2. The conflicting size metric (1.21M vs. 1.26M sq ft) is likely a contextual error but doesn’t negate the explicit tie for largest status.

**Reasoning:**  
- The context states Pietro Ferrero (d. 1949) laid the groundwork for Nutella by adding hazelnut to chocolate in the 1940s.  
- However, Nutella was **first introduced in 1965** by Ferrero SpA, the company he founded.  
- Since Pietro died 16 years before Nutella's launch, he did not introduce the final product.  
- Confidence is 1.0 because the timeline is unambiguous: Pietro’s groundwork (1940s) ≠ product launch (1965).",Pietro Ferrero never introduced the product.,False,True,,Pietro Ferrero never introduced the product.,1.0

    ""Answer"": ""Miyan Tansen"",

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states that **Darbari Kanada** was brought into North Indian music by Miyan Tansen. The question asks about the raga sung/played in *drut laya* **before** a *vilambit* composition in raga Adana. According to the context, Adana is performed in *drut laya* **after** a *vilambit* in Darbari Kanada. Thus, the raga preceding Adana is Darbari Kanada, which Miyan Tansen introduced.  

Confidence is 0.95 (very high) because:  
1. The context directly attributes Darbari Kanada's introduction to Miyan Tansen.  
2. The temporal relationship between Darbari Kanada (slow *vilambit*) and Adana (fast *drut*) is clearly stated.  
Minor uncertainty (0.05) arises from the question phrasing ""before a vilambit composition in raga Adana,"" which slightly inverts the sequence, but the logical flow remains consistent with the context.",Miyan Tansen,False,True,,Miyan Tansen,0.95

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly defines:  
> *""A Buffalo wing, in the cuisine of the United States, is an unbreaded chicken wing section [...] coated in a sauce consisting of a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and melted butter""*  

This perfectly matches the description in the question. While Hungry Howie's offers chicken wings, the cuisine term itself is ""Buffalo wings"" as defined in the context. Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) because the context doesn't explicitly state that Hungry Howie's serves *Buffalo-style* wings, though the description alignment leaves little ambiguity.",Buffalo wings,False,True,,Buffalo wings,0.95

Explanation:  
- The context explicitly states the fillér was the subdivision of the Austro-Hungarian korona in the Hungarian part of the Empire.  
- The 1999 removal date refers to the fillér as a subunit of the modern Hungarian forint, but the question specifically asks about its role in the Austro-Hungarian currency system.  
- Confidence is 0.95 (high) because the context directly links the fillér to the korona, though minor ambiguity exists from the mention of multiple currencies (korona/pengő/forint).

**Confidence Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states that the district is part of the National Bison Range Complex, which focuses on wildlife conservation (specifically mentioning the American bison sanctuary). While it doesn't list other species, the direct association with the complex implies that wildlife, particularly bison, can be found there. Confidence is 0.85 because:  
- The context directly links the district to the bison-focused complex (strong evidence).  
- No contradictory information exists.  
- It doesn't specify *exclusive* contents of the district, leaving minor room for interpretation.","The Northwest Montana Wetland Management District is part of the National Bison Range Complex, which includes wildlife refuges and the National Bison Range established as a sanctuary for American bison.",False,True,,"The Northwest Montana Wetland Management District is part of the National Bison Range Complex, which includes wildlife refuges and the National Bison Range established as a sanctuary for American bison.",0.85

**Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states ""Real Madrid won 5–3 on aggregate,"" directly answering the first part about the two-leg match winner.  
- The dates in the question (20–23 August 1997) align with the typical timing of the Spanish Super Cup, which Real Madrid would have contested as 1996–97 La Liga champions (the 66th season).  
- Confidence is 0.85 (not 1.0) because the context doesn't explicitly name the competition, though the dates and aggregate win strongly imply the Supercopa de España. Minor uncertainty exists about the exact event referenced.",Real Madrid,False,True,,Real Madrid,0.85

**Confidence Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly identifies Howard Hawks as a ""screenwriter,"" while Arthur Berthelet is solely described as a ""director"" with no mention of screenwriting.  
- This strongly suggests Hawks had screenwriting credits that Berthelet did not. However, without explicit production counts, there's a 15% chance Berthelet had unmentioned screenwriting work.  
- Confidence is high (0.85) because the context deliberately attributes screenwriting only to Hawks.","Yes, based on the context, Howard Hawks was a screenwriter while Arthur Berthelet is only described as a director, implying Hawks contributed to more productions as a screenwriter.",False,True,,"Yes, based on the context, Howard Hawks was a screenwriter while Arthur Berthelet is only described as a director, implying Hawks contributed to more productions as a screenwriter.",0.85

- The only overlapping role explicitly mentioned for both is **film director**.  
- Confidence is high (0.95) because the context provides direct evidence of this shared profession, though minor uncertainty exists due to their additional distinct roles (writer/producer).

- U.S. Highway 60 is identified as the **historic Midland Trail**.  
This directly answers both parts of the question. Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) due to the contextual assumption that the referenced byway includes Zilpo Road, though the road name itself isn't verbatim in the text.",US Highway 60,False,True,,US Highway 60,0.95

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states that ""In This Life"" was written by **Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin**, and immediately afterward provides Mike Reid's birthdate (""May 24, 1947""). Since Allen Shamblin's birthdate is *not* mentioned in the context, the only verifiable answer is Mike Reid's birthdate. Confidence is 0.9 (high) because:  
1. The birthdate is directly linked to Mike Reid in the context.  
2. The ambiguity of ""the writer"" (since there are two) slightly reduces certainty, but Reid is the only one with documented birth details here.

- Historically, they are recognized as the first fast battleships due to their unprecedented speed (24 knots), which redefined battleship design.

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states:  
- ""The Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, is a piece of organ music written, according to its oldest extant sources, by Johann Sebastian Bach.""  

This is a direct attribution with no ambiguity in the provided text. Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) because:  
1. The phrasing ""according to its oldest extant sources"" implies historical documentation rather than absolute certainty.  
2. While widely accepted, some modern scholars debate BWV 565's authorship (though this is external knowledge beyond the given context).

2. Only **Ivan** reached Category 5 strength (""Ivan reached Category 5 strength"")  
3. Frances is not mentioned as Category 5  

The 0.95 confidence reflects:  
- Clear contextual linkage of Ivan to Category 5  
- Minor uncertainty due to the joint mention of both hurricanes causing flooding

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states Isoplexis is ""flowering plants.""  
- While Quince isn't directly labeled ""flowering,"" its family (Rosaceae) exclusively comprises flowering plants (angiosperms), making this an inherent characteristic.  
- No other shared traits are mentioned in the context, leaving ""flowering plants"" as the only verifiable commonality.  
- Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) due to the slight inferential step for Quince, though the botanical classification is unambiguous.",They are both flowering plants.,False,True,,They are both flowering plants.,0.95

- The only unambiguous shared characteristic stated is that both belong to the plant kingdom.

- The Earls of Exeter were elevated to Marquesses of Exeter, meaning the same family held both titles and owned Exeter House.

- Both fall under the overarching category of **operas**, as ""music drama"" is a stylistic form within opera.

- Confidence is 0.85 (high) because:  
  - The film title and award year directly match the question.

- **Wachovia Securities** includes ""investment banking subsidiaries"" under its operations, confirming its role in investment banking.

- Confidence is high (0.95) due to explicit definitions, with minor reservation for potential interpretation of Wachovia's subsidiary structure.","TD Securities is explicitly described as an investment bank.

- Bikini Kill (a separate band active in the 1990s) disbanded in 1997, but the context contains **no link** between Sam Roberts and Bikini Kill.  
- Confidence is 0.95 (high) because:  
  • Roberts' timeline (Canadian rock, signed 2002) doesn't align with Bikini Kill (US punk, 1990-1997).  
  • The disbanding in 1997 refers to Roberts' unnamed band, not Bikini Kill.

- His heritage (""Jewish-Polish and Irish descent"") directly matches the question's query for a ""Jewish-Polish-Irish bandleader"" (where ""bandleader"" is contextually synonymous with ""conductor"" here).  
- Confidence is near-certain (0.99) since the context provides unambiguous, direct evidence. The minor deduction accounts for the informal term ""bandleader"" instead of ""conductor,"" though it does not create meaningful doubt.",Leopold Anthony Stokowski,False,True,,Leopold Anthony Stokowski,0.99

- Charles Simonyi (not mentioned in the context but known from external knowledge) flew only **two space missions** (Soyuz TMA-10 in 2007 and TMA-14 in 2009).

- No other band members are mentioned in connection with this appointment.

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states: ""the Mastiff is noted for [...] a limited range of colours,"" confirming this trait applies to the English Mastiff. For the Landseer, the context only mentions it is a ""white and black Newfoundland"" without addressing color range limitations. The 0.95 confidence reflects near certainty about the Mastiff's color limitation, with minor uncertainty due to the Landseer's specific color pattern not being explicitly labeled as ""limited"" in the provided text.",The English Mastiff has a limited range of colors.,False,True,,The English Mastiff has a limited range of colors.,0.95

- No other actors in the film's cast list are mentioned in connection with the episode.

**Confidence Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states Caesars' 2013 revenue ($8.6 billion) and confirms ownership of Rio Secco Golf Club.  
- Confidence is not 1.0 because the data is from 2013, and revenue may have changed significantly since then.  
- The answer acknowledges the data's age to avoid misinterpretation as current information.","The annual revenue of Caesars Entertainment Corporation, which owns Rio Secco Golf Club, was $8.6 billion in 2013 according to the context.

- ""Call Me Crazy"" is an album by Lee Ann Womack (not a single), and ""Solitary Thinkin'"" was released as a single from it.  
The question inaccurately refers to ""Call Me Crazy"" as a single, but both works are attributed to Lee Ann Womack.

- The mention of Southeast Asia's biodiversity appears unrelated to the reserve's location, serving as a comparative statement.

- The context explicitly states ITC Sangeet Research Academy is located in **Kolkata, India**.  
- Girija Devi is mentioned in the same context as an Indian classical singer, but the text does not explicitly state her current association with the academy. Her biographical details (birthdate/gharana) are provided separately.  
- Confidence is 0.85 because while the academy's location is unambiguous, the linkage to Girija Devi relies on contextual proximity rather than a direct statement.","Kolkata, India",False,True,,"Kolkata, India",0.85

**Confidence Explanation**:  
The context explicitly states Billy Corgan's birthdate as March 17, 1967, and confirms he is the band leader associated with the album. The confidence is slightly below 1.0 to account for potential ambiguities in project naming (""Teargarden by Kaleidyscope"" being the overarching work), though the direct birthdate reference leaves minimal uncertainty.","The leader of the band that released Monuments to an Elegy, Billy Corgan, was born on March 17, 1967.",False,True,,"The leader of the band that released Monuments to an Elegy, Billy Corgan, was born on March 17, 1967.",0.98

- For Burlington, the context states the airport is **3 nautical miles** from Burlington's central business district (though the text incorrectly associates Sawyer with Burlington; the distance comparison itself remains valid).  
- 17 nm > 3 nm confirms Sawyer is farther.  
- Confidence is 0.85 (not 1.0) due to minor contextual ambiguity about Burlington's location, but the distance metrics are unambiguous.",Sawyer International Airport,False,True,,Sawyer International Airport,0.85

- Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) due to Rick Cleveland's co-writing credit on the Emmy-winning episode, though Sorkin is the primary creator of all three shows mentioned.

    ""Confidence"": 0.7
}

Explanation:  
- The context states that Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio scored the winning goal in the match referenced (2005–06 DFB-Pokal final).  
- His full name is provided as ""Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio"", where ""Miguel"" is a middle name and ""Pizarro"" is typically considered a surname. However, the question specifically asks for ""two middle names"".  
- In Hispanic naming conventions, ""Miguel"" is a middle name, and ""Pizarro"" is the paternal surname. Since the question explicitly requests ""two middle names"", the answer combines ""Miguel"" and ""Pizarro"" as they appear sequentially after the first name in the given context.  
- Confidence is 0.7 because:  
  - The context clearly identifies Claudio Pizarro as the goal-scorer.  
  - The name structure in the text (""Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bosio"") supports ""Miguel Pizarro"" as the immediate names following the first name.  
  - However, cultural naming norms might interpret ""Pizarro"" as a surname rather than a middle name, introducing mild ambiguity.

**Explanation:**  
The context identifies Stefan Ruzowitzky as Austrian and Jeremy Kagan as American with explicit credits in American film/television. While Ruzowitzky may have some American projects, Kagan's career is fundamentally rooted in the U.S. industry as a director, screenwriter, and producer. This strongly implies Kagan has more American film credits, though the exact counts aren't provided.

- In contrast, Gene Saks (implied by ""his"" in the latter sentences) is highlighted for theater achievements: Broadway debut, Tony Awards for directing plays, and induction into the American Theater Hall of Fame.  
- The pronoun shift (""his"") confirms the second part refers to Gene Saks, whose theater work overshadows any film recognition in the given context.

List served as Governor of Nevada (1979-1983), and Yucca Mountain is located in Nevada.

- The context explicitly states U.S. Route 61 runs for ""1400 mi"" between New Orleans and Wyoming, Minnesota.  
- It confirms the community (Doloroso, Mississippi) rests on U.S. Route 61.  
- No other highways or conflicting mileages are mentioned.  
- Confidence is 0.95 (very high) because the mileage is directly stated in the context, with minor uncertainty only around whether Doloroso is definitively part of the referenced ""community"" (though logically implied).",1400 mi,False,True,,1400 mi,0.95

Explanation:
- The context explicitly states that the Australian Open is ""chronologically the first of the four Grand Slam tennis events of the year"" and was ""first held in 1905.""
- Since the US Open is the final major in the calendar, the Australian Open (1905) is the first major held before it each year.
- Confidence is 0.8 (not 1.0) because the context doesn't provide start dates for Wimbledon (1877) or the French Open (1891), which are older tournaments. However, the question specifically references the Grand Slam sequence, and the context designates the Australian Open as the first in that sequence.",1905 (Australian Open),False,True,,1905 (Australian Open),0.8

The context states: ""Early in his career, he was best known for playing Dan Conner on the ABC TV series 'Roseanne'..."". The preceding list of voice actors includes John Goodman, who is historically known for playing Dan Conner. The confidence is 0.95 (very high) because:  
1. The context directly links ""he"" to the Dan Conner role.  
2. John Goodman is the only actor in the cast list with this iconic role.  
3. The 5% uncertainty accounts for potential ambiguities in pronoun references, though the context strongly supports Goodman.",John Goodman,False,True,,John Goodman,0.95

The context explicitly lists Huxley's professions as ""writer, novelist, philosopher, and prominent member of the Huxley family"" (4 distinct roles), while Carver is described as a ""short-story writer and poet"" (2 roles). This indicates Huxley had broader professional scope.

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly lists Huxley as a ""writer, novelist, philosopher,"" while Carver is described as a ""short-story writer and poet."" Huxley's inclusion of ""philosopher"" as a distinct professional domain beyond writing indicates a wider scope compared to Carver's specialization within literature.

- No other actresses in the cast list are mentioned with an August 26 birthday.

**Confidence Explanation:**  
- The context explicitly states Putnam's marriage to Amelia Earhart.  
- Historical records confirm Earhart as the first woman to solo the Atlantic (1932).

The context explicitly states:

- The cemetery is described as ""over 400 acre[s].""  
While the film was shot *primarily* in Albany, NY, the cemetery itself—which meets the ""400-acre pastoral"" criterion—is physically situated in Colonie. The confidence is 0.95 (very high) because the context directly links Colonie to the cemetery, though the phrasing of the question could slightly obscure whether it asks for the primary filming town (Albany) or the cemetery's specific location (Colonie).","Colonie, New York",False,True,,"Colonie, New York",0.95

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states Sansha administers multiple island groups (Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, etc.), indicating it comprises numerous islands.  
- Xingning is described solely as a land-based city with area/population metrics, with no mention of islands.  
- Confidence is 0.95 (not 1.0) due to the *remote possibility* of unmentioned islands in Xingning, though the context strongly implies Sansha is island-centric while Xingning is not.","No, Sansha contains more islands than Xingning, Guangdong.",False,True,,"No, Sansha contains more islands than Xingning, Guangdong.",0.95

- Calendula is native to ""southwestern Asia, western Europe, Macaronesia, and the Mediterranean""  

The confidence is 0.98 (not 1.0) because:

**Explanation:**  
The context explicitly states:  
- ""The Southern Baptist Convention [...] is the largest non-Catholic Christian denomination in the United States""  
- Russell D. Moore is described as an evangelical theologian and ethicist, and historically served as president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC), which is the policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC).  

While Moore headed the ERLC (a subsidiary entity), the denomination itself is the SBC. The question’s phrasing (""denomination headed by"") is slightly ambiguous, but the SBC is the core organization. Confidence is 0.95 because:  
- The context directly names the SBC as the denomination.  
- Moore’s leadership role in the ERLC ties him to the SBC structure.  
- Minor ambiguity exists in whether ""headed"" refers to the denomination or its subsidiary, but the SBC is the unambiguous answer for the denomination.",Southern Baptist Convention,False,True,,Southern Baptist Convention,0.95

- It mentions **only one ranking for Ann Wilson** (Hit Parader).  
- Thus, Clapton appears on three lists versus Wilson's one.

- Super Bowl V occurred in the 1970 season, within his active career span.

- Confidence is 0.95 (very high) because the context directly links Stephen Devassy to the film's music.

Reasoning:

**Reasoning:**  
- The context explicitly states Mike Connors was ""Armenian-American"".  
- Leon Danielian is described as ""American"", but his surname ""Danielian"" is distinctly Armenian. Combined with the cultural context (Armenian names rarely appearing in other ethnic groups), this strongly indicates Armenian heritage.  
- Confidence is 0.9 (not 1.0) because Danielian's Armenian background is inferred rather than explicitly stated in the provided context.",Both Mike Connors and Leon Danielian were American entertainers of Armenian heritage.,False,True,,Both Mike Connors and Leon Danielian were American entertainers of Armenian heritage.,0.9
